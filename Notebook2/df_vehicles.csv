all Chevy truck beds rust out. junk bodies.,0
junk,0
Don't  Fit very good,0
This car has had nothing but issues. Nissan will not stand by there product so every repair bill becomes a fight with Nissan or a loss of money.,0
I will never buy another Tahoe again. Ive had so many problems with things going wrong with this vehicle. I feel like maybe GM programs the engines to have troubles so that they can continue to profit on repairs. I will buy foreign next.,0
"Built Cheap, 2mths old and the door lock fell into the door. Eats tires like a hog 80,000 miles 4 sets. The body is flimsy and plastic discolors easily.  Drips oil all over the place. Sets ripped at the seams. Get above 65 on the highway and it walks all over the place. Gas milage stinks, really it stinks. 26ish on the highway and 22 around town. Needs a catalytic converter and that costs more than the book value of the car. Yeah, $1,100. I would not trust my Aveo for a road trip for more than 35 miles.
I will say that I'll never buy another Chevrolet.",0
"Needed head gasket, water pump, thermostat. Sill overheated. Took it  back when tire made grinding noise right after fixing the radiator fans that stooped working. All this happened in 4 months.",0
Electrical nightmare! Rebuilt entire front end before computer went out!  Second and last Chrysler I'll ever buy! 4 wheel drive was awesome after I changed all the axle joints!,0
"Would give zero stars if I could.  What a piece of crap, cared for regularly but yet for an 08 car,  by 121k miles bcm went out,  service air bag,  tpms,  traction control all lit up,  radio stopped working,  rear suspension clunks, clear coat peeling, chews up tires.",0
Lousy model.  Have had nothing but problems since I bought it!  Disgraceful excuse for a vehicle.,0
Most of those models have a issue with fuel pump leak.  It had case 2012 with NHSA and Mercedes extended warranty for that.  But if you coming to dealers they can tell you that this car is not covered. Pump has to replaced with whole tank for 4100$. What kind of system is that??? Some small repair like fuel pump can cost more than half car value...,0
Fragile. Too much plastic. Poorly built. Something was always breaking on it from top to bottom,0
Alot of the parts you say will fit my car don't fit,0
"Nothing about this vehicle good. Transmission is horrible and in three years the value of depreciation to a third of the sticker price. Buy something else, you won't regret it.",0
do not work at  all  after mechanic  do it,0
Hated my 6.0 biggest pile Ive ever had. Bought a 2010 Dodge Ram got rid of the ford.,0
Have already broken. After I paid 80.00 to have them programmed. Will be returning them soon,0
"We bought this car for our daughter in college because of the Buick name.  We have had Buick's with 3.8L engines and they were tanks. Not this one!  I also have a friend with the same year and same model and he won't buy a GM again because of it.  The engine has been great, just everything else is bad.  Constantly fixing things on this car.",0
"Been a very poor truck, with many repairs needed over 10 years of ownership.  Two rear ends, one transmission, and one overhauled motor along with many minor repairs.",0
"Worst car I've ever driven. Terrible safety ratings. And it even feels like a screaming metal deathtrap while driving it. If I wanted to put my life at risk for something worthwhile I'd drive something from the 50s or 60s but somehow I still imagine it'd be safer. Its small and I'm tall. Its rims are tiny. Right now its burning a qt of oil every 700 miles. There's no shortage of spare parts. The junkyards have 100s of these things laying to rot. I just don't want to put any money into it. A random part of the car falls off at least once a month. Last time it was the rubber gasket/weatherseal around the drivers side headlight. There is a rust cancer so bad under the hood that everytime I close it little bits of rust rain down, like the pine needles on Charlie Browns christmas tree. But this card definitely needs more than a little love. It needs to be taken outback and crushed into a cube like Brave Little Toaster.",0
"My husband wanted a convertible and bought this car on his own.  It is a total piece of crap.  I'd love to donate it to a charity when he's not looking.  It's broken down most of the time, so I doubt that we've put 500 miles on it since he bought it 6 years ago.",0
I just want to buy the damn car not give it stars and reviews and read other people's opinions of everything they don't know about.,0
"2016 Laramie Ram 2500 with Cummins 6.7 diesel engine. After 18 months and only 1200 miles, I have had it in the shop to replace 4 different sensors (fuel gauge, front sensor, main sensor board). Truck now has 3 recalls: water pump, can drop out of Park, and rims can crack. Dealer informs me that they do not have replacement parts at this time.

My experience has been poor. Nice truck to drive but Ram has major issues!",0
Not the best vehicle ive ever owned but own it i do none the less,0
Yo yo id be runin hot like coal brah,0
Which item?,0
"I really dislike this car, I will not be buying another one.",0
"Factory 4x4 vacuum system guaranteed to break.  Window regulators will fail, causing cables to snap in door.  Windows will fall into door.",0
"Don't make the same mistake as me - do NOT buy a PT Cruiser. In the 6 years I had it, I only put 6000 miles on it but had to spend thousands in maintenance. Door locks, multi function switch, engine mounts, ac compressor, sway bars, plenty of others I can't remember off the top of my head. At the time of trade-in, it would barely start, shuddered and screamed in reverse, and this was barely two months after $1200 in repairs. We never drove it long distance as we didn't trust it not to break down. Save yourself the headache and get any other car. A Little Tikes would be more reliable and less stressful.",0
"Purchased this truck 02/15/2016 and it has been nothing but trouble first the transmission started shifting very hard and then not at all barely made to the dealers, they had it 2 weeks and had to put in a whole new trans, when I got the truck back the nav and stereo stopped working and the steering started pulling to the right, took the truck back in to the dealer, it took them to more weeks, they had to replace both and wanted to charge me $1879 I said what about the warranty, they the steering column I have to pay for, I said why is that, they said it is not covered by the warranty, so the fight started and went on for 5 weeks after a talk with my lawyer they change their mind to cover it. The truck started getting a lot of squeaks and rattles from the dash and doors around 5 to 6 mouths of ownership
{4500 miles}, I said that's enough traded it for a Ford F-150 and took a big hit for the trade but I was not keeping that truck. Purchased the F150 12/28/2016 and have loved it so far better mileage better towing everything has been good on this truck. I've owned a lot of pickup's over the years but that is the worst I've ever had and will not be buying a GM again!",0
Defective,0
"This is the worst car that I have ever owned, money pit!!! Cam follower problems, Vac problems, the list goes on!!! STAY AWAY!!!!",0
Very poorly built vehicle. I have the fully loaded S model and it constantly has something wrong. It's nice to look at but built terribly. Worst purchase I've ever made.,0
Too many common problems for a high end vehicle,0
Sucks,0
NO REPLACEMENT FOR PETROL ENGINES,0
"Fun to drive until everything started falling apart at 65k. Electronics, oil consumption, leaks, check the Jeep message boards. I would not take another one of these vehicles if someone gave it to me.",0
"My son bought this against my recommendation. He has driven it less than 10000 miles and has so far spent $6000 on repairs. It seems that there is always something going wrong, much of it faulty electrics but includes everything from head gasket replacement on two different occasions, fuel pump, water pump, radiator, condenser, emission controls, dropped windows just to name a few. It currently needs a replacement a/c compressor, so he is trying to save up another $1300 for the repair, even though the car is only worth about $1000! From what I have read online, this model is notorious for breakdowns. I can't understand why anyone in their right mind would want one.",0
"Great car. Cheater diesel. 70k miles, 45mpg. Sold back to VW due to dumping 40X NO2 into the environment. Would buy another diesel, but never another VW.",0
i thought this was a hot wheels car,0
It was the wrong part and I sent it back it did not look like the one I had and it didn't solve the problem. My element is a 2004 so was probably for a different year. They also charged me shipping to send it back even though it was stated that it would work on my vehicle. I was not happy about that charge of a return shipping fee! !,0
Part did not fit factory wires had to buy a different one from a parts store,0
Lose one already and others are louse any chance of getting replacements otherwise don't email me again,0
I gave it one star as there is no option for zero stars. The car is my sisters. I would highly recommend that you spend a bit more and get a Civic or Tercel. You will save money in the long run. I am a lifelong Chevy owner but this car is a complete joke. Don't waste your money on one unless it is 20% below scrap price.,0
"Ha!!! Sober up and buy something else. I was given this car 6 years ago with 30,000 miles on it. All in all it's been a good GO TO WORK car. I have always struggled getting heat. The cooling system rusts terribly and clogs the heater core. If you are wanting a cheap used car, I would move on up to something from this century.",0
"Nothing but trouble.  Only has 110K miles but the air compressor is out, the cats are clogged, the engine has always had a slight clank and a weird smell which everyone tells me is normal on this car.  Repairs are way more than what this car is worth.",0
I have nothing but trouble with this thing. Issues with it shutting off while driving and stalling out and dealership said GMC wouldnt cover it. This has been happening since 20k miles and still doing it. Feels cheaply made but its hard getting a real truck these days.,0
Claimed it fit my car and it did not,0
"Worst purchase I ever made. Van is in and out of shop monthly with costly repairs. There has been so many recalls, lost count.",0
If you're looking for a suv I'd check into another one..we have had nothing but problems since the day we got this vehicle..,0
"It really is a piece of crap too many problems, it overheats, for some reason heater stops working, track control and ABS lights come on. I don't recommend anybody to buy this car brand new let alone used, you will by buying other people problems.
The crappies car from Chevrolet.",0
"Fantastic engine supplied by an Italian company called VM, but everything else was complete garbage. This vehicle ended up being a great engine in search of a decent car. The transmission went out totally at 65,000 miles!!!! Total garbage, never buy another FCA vehicle again. Maybe Chevy will do it better justice in the Colorado.",0
I bout it for a kiddie car and my 2 year old said it was 2 slow,0
"This truck has been a piece of junk ever since I bought it new. (Professional Grade is only marketing.) It seems better now that it doesn't have many original parts left on it, and the new tailgate and gas-cap cover and cab corners even make it look pretty decent. Too bad they all rot out and the plastic handles break so easily. Many things were covered by the extended warranty, since it started breaking down while it was still basically new,  but transmission and wheel bearings went shortly after it expired.  Make sure you have a spare truck because this one will likely be in the shop a lot. I've gotten to know my repair guy pretty well over the past several years, (thinking about direct deposit.) Too bad new Heavy Duty trucks are so expensive. And too bad Toyota and Nissan don't make a 3/4 ton. I'll probably eventually give a Ford-250 a try. Good luck.",0
"Car is junk. With exhaust upgrades is ok. But head gadgets are weak, timing belts are junk overall not a good car",0
"Engine is good, all other parts too bad. I fixed too many time and hard to fix. But my Honda and Toyota only changed battery.",0
"Worst decision I have ever made. It's been in for service about 20 times, it's had a ton of parts replaced: cam sensors, cam phasers, crank sensors, both front door panels, 3 speakers, rear trim panel, exterior trim panel. It always smells like coolant and has continuous transmission problems. Stay away!!!",0
If I had the choice to give NEGITIVE stars I would! The headlights were already USED and BROKE!!! And the return policy isn't the best either. This is the first time I've received  something like this for Amazon and I'm definitely NOT happy about it.,0
will never buy another one!! Car was great but motor was not! Never buy a car with a 2.7 engine in it!!,0
Everything they said will fit but that was not true and force me to just used even that's not my car size.,0
"Pos, under powered, gass over flows every fill up, burns a quart of oil every 1000 miles, and Chrysler issued statement that burning that much oil is totally normal... total bs...",0
Lights would not come on properly. Lights would only come on when truck wasn't running. If truck was on an light switch was turned on lights would not work!,0
biggest money pit I've ever owned.,0
"These Blazers are throw away cars. They are made to go about 100,000 miles. Then crushed and melted down where they will be turned into crowbars and anvils.  I have about 146,000 on mine. It had 102,000 when I purchased it in 2008. I didn't realize then that it was used up! So I kept fixing things as they broke. Things like New A/C compressor $600 dollars. New actuator and computer board that shifts it from 2 wd to 4 wd High and
4 wd Low. $1200 dollars. New intake manifold gasket $478 (because factory gasket is part plastic and rubber, so the plastic fails which causes the rubber to leak)  New fuel pump $750. New seal between Transmission and Transfer case. $450. (Transmission fluid will leak into and eventually fill your transfer case when this seal goes out) Directional vacuum valve mounted on your transfer case that when it leaks sucks transfer case oil into your heater and A/C actuators which will cause them to fail. Plastic frames on vanity mirrors on sun visors will
disintegrate over time and lights on mirrors will stay on running down your battery. These are not all the problems, but they are a good start. I have owned cars with higher miles and had much better results than this 2002 Blazer produced. I take care of my vehicles. I service them regularly. I don't rod nor race them. These Blazers are intended by the manufacturer  to be replaced after ex-amount of miles. I am sure the first guy who put the 102,000 thousand on it had great things to say about the Blazer. It was the Second Guy (or me) who got to fix everything that wore out on the first guy!! Spend your money somewhere else. This Rig ain't worth it!!",0
"This car hands down was the worst car ive ever owned.  Bought new, but had problems after problems.  Good thing I had the extended warranty. Eventually I cut my losses and traded it in for something else.  Will never buy another Nissan.",0
"This part did not fit even when on the website it said it did,also no hole for the pump.",0
"will never buy another nissan, cheaply made, drives rough,",0
"Chrysler must have hired engineers to sabotage this car!. Their is insufficient air flow to cool the engine. The holes in the front facia do not line up with the holes in the bumper. This engine (2.7 liter) needs an oil cooler and not one inside the radiator. The 2.7 engine pools excessive amounts of oil in the cylinder heads, probably an attempt to help cool the engine. With the engine mounted longitudinally, more oil pools. Check dipstick oil level with engine running. I always run 1/2 to 1 quart too much oil, 1 quart low will prove to be catastrophic. Catalytic converters are way to close to an already hot engine. Water pump inside an engine, ridiculous idea, coolant will get into the oil, weep holes are not going to stop it. Plastic coolant inlet and outlet housings that are glued together, come on! Monsterous timing chain, Hydraulic chain tensioner???? If check ball inside tensioner gets a little bit of dirt or sludge from this sludge motor it can loosen up the timing chain while the engine sits overnight, an possible timing chain jump with bent valves can happen. Install stop block!! Beautiful car, handles excellent, steering maybe a little aggressive, suspension a little to firm, excellent gas mileage, I can get 32 mpg on highway, very roomy, comfortable, extremely large trunk. The larger engines 3.2 or 3.5 are much better.  I have improved air flow with an air dam installed a larger trans cooler and added an oil cooler where the battery use to be, and moved battery to trunk. Replace timing chain and installed improved water pump. Drive the car easy!!! This engine can survive.",0
"This truck has proven to me that everything I ever thought about Chevy's is true.  Horrible gas mileage (15mpg tops) when my 09 F150 would get 19-20mpg,  Has left me stranded multiple times due to oiling issues that have never been resolved.  Handles like a old tank, the body roll on this thing is ridiculous.  Can't wait to get it paid off so I can get myself back into an F150.",0
"Poor battery life, back up camera went black. Lots of issues.",0
Broke down pretty easily not built to last timing cover goes first if you buy this thing second hand chances are the person thought it was bullet proof and never kept up with it....cheap to fix yes but not worth it,0
The gas cap leaks in the hot sun and  messed  up the paint job around it.,0
"This is by far the worst vehicle I have ever owned. It is the 6.0 liter engine and it stays broken. I have at one time or another changed many of the parts and it almost stays broken. I sometimes get a few hundred miles between repairs and sometimes only a few miles. It is broken down now when I got only a few hundred miles after changing all the glow plugs, injectors, harnessed and few other items. I made about 500 hundred miles and now its is down again. They are now talking about having to re-stud the engine. Where does it stop?",0
"We bought one of these in extremely good condition. It took us over $4000 to keep this piece of garbage running for all of 3 years. Now it has a misfire so bad that it's about to throw a rod. It's got a pathetically weak engine, eats gas like no one's business, and if you live in a mountainous region? This thing will sooner sprout wings than actually pull its own weight. Not to mention it guzzles even more gas. I have a lincoln now that's 6 years older, not to mention being an 8 cylinder and in poor condition, and yet it goes through half the gas off this thing.

And if you do DIY repair work, I wish you luck. We've have at least three separate mechanics cringe when we mentioned the car while looking for parts. They outright said at the local kia dealership that Sedonas were the worst to work on. I won't repeat the things my mechanic father has said about the experience...

Maybe these vans were nice when they first came out, but frankly, they just don't stand the test of time.",0
Always in the shop. Stay away!,0
It has had quality issues 16 times to shop for repairs so that 32 times round trip. 4 recalls 2 or 3 letters stating there could be some other issues & 3 issues currently. I've talked to Buick alot & there is no help from them but 100.00. Great vehicle but lots of problems.,0
was hoping gas mpg was better. i like the rav 4 very much,0
engine problems,0
"Had this car for 3 months. Already have over 3 dozen notifications from On-star, sirius and the dealer. Its absolutely crazy that they monitor every single aspect and track your driving and location at every moment. Last month got a record saying I had 3 quick starts with the vehicle. If you value your privacy please never buy a chevy vehicle with On star.( It cannot be shut off) BTW I already had a recall on this vehicle, now I must bring it back to the dealer. what more can I say?",0
"Arrived broken. One very important clip was broken off the new part. Thankfully I was able to pull the piece off my old handle. The piece was not in the bag, so it was damaged at the factory and shipped.",0
"Summary:
If you're going to buy a German car, buy the highest performance variant you can afford (Audi S/RS/R*, BMW M*, etc.).  At least then, you can justify the repairs and maintenance costs.

Full review:
First, the positives.  We had a 2010 A4 Avant with the sport package.  The car was gorgeous, inside and out.  We had a 2009 A4 sedan that we were fairly happy with, but the wagon fit our needs at the time.  Fuel economy:  Not too bad, 26 mpg around town, mid 30's on the highway.

Now, the negatives:
1.  Burned through oil.  Went from 1 qt. every 3000 miles down to 1 qt. every 600 miles.  At 80k miles, the local Audi deal replaced rings and pistons under a service advisory.  We had noticed the oil usage since the car had less than 10k miles on it.  The process to stay on top of the oil usage and finally get the repair done took a few years.  Also, the fuel economy dropped significantly once the rings and pistons were replaced.  Around town, the average dropped to 22 mpg, and 28 mpg on the highway.
2.  Constantly out of alignment.  I'd owned a few BMW M3's prior to this Audi, and they were driven much harder.  I never had alignment issues.  In the six years we owned the Audi, it had at least five alignments.  We paid for all of those out of pocket.
3.  Ate through tires.  It didn't matter what types of tires we put on the car, they wouldn't last more than 20k miles.  Again, coming from a few BMW M3's with fairly high performance tires, and driven hard, rear tires would last 15k to 20k miles.  For an easily driven wagon, it was unacceptable that it chewed through tires.  We stayed on top of alignments and kept the tires inflated.  They still wore unevenly.
4.  Injector stuck open, flooded one cylinder, had to get the car towed.  Again, another extended service item where we paid for the tow, but Audi covered the repair.  We didn't get reimbursed for the tow.  It's disappointing that Audi knew about the flooding injectors, but decided to be reactive instead of proactive.  This happened less than a week after the rings and pistons had been replaced.
5.  After a major service (at a trusted independent shop), noticed a hesitation at ~3k RPMs on the highway.  This was the last straw.  The car didn't have more than 85k lightly driven miles, we'd just dumped thousands of dollars into maintenance, repairs, etc. and we were still anticipating issues with the diverter valve and wastegate (requiring a turbo replacement).
6.  Residual value was abysmal.  We're used to German/luxury cars depreciating, but all the VW/Audi issues seemed to have an additional detrimental effect on the value of the car.  The Audi sales person even had the gall to tell us that these luxury cars are basically being built as disposable items, so keeping one past three years was a fool's proposition.

We traded the Audi in a few days later for a new Honda Pilot.  We talked ourselves out of a new Audi Q5 because of the existing issues with the wagon, and the typical German a-la-carte options list which didn't seem to include a back-up camera till the price was well over $50k.

In no way am I anti German/luxury car.  I can still justify purchasing a high performance German car (Audi S/RS/R series, BMW M, etc.), because you do get something substantially unique from the rest of the line-up.  Our biggest mistake was purchasing what we thought was a utility German vehicle (with some expectation of reliability), but it comes with a majority the maintenance and repairs costs as a higher performance German vehicle.  With that said, I do wish Audi would have imported the S4 or RS4 Avant.  If they had, we would have purchased one of those, we would still own it, and we would happily pay the cost to keep it up without a complaint.",0
"The model years 2004-2008 Tritons are a joke and Ford should be ashamed.
- Terrible spark plug design
- Heat/AC actuator issues
- Intake manifold actuator issues
- Cam phaser issues (most serious)

I am on my 3rd motor because of the Cam phasers and have had all of the other issues listed.  When it makes sense for me financially, I'm going to get rid of this truck.  Ford should be ashamed and should have done more for owners struggling with these issues.  Steer clear of this truck!",0
This vehicle wiggled and wobbles to the left and or right when driving. I'm afraid of it.,0
"Blower motors, front and rear o2 sensors, breaking rear springs, frame rust, paint peel front bumper, a/c problems, abs braking system faults, engine coils, clutch petal, clutch. This truck continuously has something breaking down before I can get last item fixed. I consider this the worst truck I have ever purchased. Replacement parts cost are outrageous.",0
"This car has had so many issues ... the repairs have been costly and frequent. It seems this car spends a good amount of time in the shop. Just spent $2500 on plastic crap replacement of parts that Volkswagen knows they will warp. The mechanic at Volkswagen expressed his discust with the plastic crap engine cover that warps... can not with stand the heat. Basically a 80,0000 miles I have almost a brand new engine as almost everything has been replaced. The moon roof leaked, water pump, turbo issues the list goes on and on. Getting a Tesla soon . I will never buy Volkswagen again . I cannot rely on the car.",0
"Engine started shaking after 6 months of our purchase.  We took it to the dealer that said there is nothing we could find, you should live with it and see how ford escape engine shakes!.  After about 3 years, AC stopped working.  At 20K miles, we had to change its original tires since it failed inspection.  It rolls back on a small slope at stop lights (very dangerous if the person behind you is very close). Very cheap material, very expensive for how it is made.  It gets very poor milage which defeats the purpose of getting a small car to save money on gas.  We put less than 50K miles on it so far, have all the scheduled maintenance done on time, but noise comes from everywhere in the car (road noise is terrible on this car; no insulation).  it is one of the the worst made cars in the market.  We just bought it to give our money to an American manufacturer in late 2009, during the Great Recession.  It was our $20K gamble, which was worse than Las Vegas casinos, I guess.  Resale value is very bad; we tried to get another car when we realize it was a badly made car after 9 months (4K miles), dealer offered $11K trade in; 50% depreciation in less than a year.  We regretted it buying very much. We will never ever buy a ford car again.",0
"Worst car I've ever had the displeasure of working on. You can't get to anything, the cooling system will need replaced multiple times throughout the car's useful life, every little piece of plastic breaks, the transmission cooling lines leak until you create your own solution.... oh, and try driving when it's sunny! The angle of the windshield = glare no matter what.",0
I will never own another beetle in my life,0
"Did not fit, even after cutting it",0
"I loved it at first but over the past couple of years more and more things keep breaking on it.  Two of my doors will not open from the outside and it took an act of congress to get them to fix it as a recall item.  All the warning lights are on on the dash.  No explanation.  Tires wear out quickly (on the inside) because of how the suspension is set up.  The shock mounts in the front are worn out at 140,000 miles.  Paint bubbled up around my windshield and is now flaking off.  Sometimes when you crank the car it surges forward like it's in drive.  No explanation from Kia as to why.  On a positive note, very comfortable to drive.  Handles great, rides great.  Seats are comfortable.  The microfiber seat covers are not easily cleaned.  I've tried a dozen different products and none will bring stains out of them.  Many positives but an overwhelming number of negatives.  I won't personally buy another Kia.",0
The product I ordered didn't come with the CLIPS to install it with,0
While installing this the bolt broke in half.,0
"G6 coupe v6 motor, almost killed me twice",0
Do not buy a Volvo I regret  buying this car I cant wait to get it out of my life,0
Amazing power!,0
"I had to get rid of the vehicle after 6 months on three occasions it shifted into neutral when I was driving, the service center put in a lot of what they call ""flashes"" but it continued and the last time I was nearly rear ended since my car went from 50 mph to 20mph in a second",0
This first.and the last  time I'll buy from this company. I've have bought other remotes. They have always came with directions easy to follow. To get it programed not these.,0
If you want rims to put on your wall than buy these cause they won't fit on your car...,0
Back seat cover doesn't fit properly.,0
"This is a car to avoid if you have any other options at all.  Its light weight, narrow track, and high profile make it an adventure in any crosswind, and downright unstable in a crosswind in the rain.  The timing belt, water pump, and idler pulleys have to be changed every 60,000 miles, and castastrophic engine failure will occur if you go very far over that number.  The plastic nozzle on the water intake failed at 40,000 miles, resulting in total water loss, and the cheap plastic part was not covered by warranty even though Chevy clearly knew it was defective, having replaced it with a mental part.  The cheap radiator connector fractured a 100,000 miles, again resulting in total loss of coolant.  The front end is almost impossible to keep in alignment, falling out of alignment if you bump into anything at all with it.  Overall, it's cheap, basic transportation with the emphasis on cheap.",0
"I have a 2017 Ford Fusion Sport (AWD with the 2.7L twin-turbo EcoBoost). On paper, this is really a great car with the latest in technology: continuous computer controlled electronic dampers, AWD, LED headlights, LED foglights, SYNC3 with Android Auto and Apple Car Play, heated/cooled seats, etc... A very updated and European interior/exterior design. But the interior is designed for short people. I'm 6'3"" and my heat is almost jammed against the roof. What they didn't mention was the extremely low-profile tires that pop like balloons. It comes with 235/40R19 Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric All-Seasons. I've gone through 2 tires within 3 days due to the potholes in Southeast Michigan. These tires cannot handle any impact whatsoever. I've had 255/45R19's on my 2014 Taurus SHO go through similar potholes without incident. Both times with the Fusion Sport, the sidewall ruptured and I lost all pressure. Ford claims the car is designed for all 50 states, yada yada yada, but this to me is a critical safety factor. I now have to change my driving routines to avoid all pothole ridden roads in Southeast Michigan, which is NOT easy especially when the weather warms up to thaw the roads/ice. If you live in Florida or California, you probably won't even care about my review.

But for someone like me that has driven for 20+ years in all weather conditions, the Fusion Sport has been by far the worst car choice I've ever made and I regret every moment I decided to lease it. I have absolutely zero confidence driving it on a normal road as every single bump will make me wonder if the tire(s) have popped, followed by the dreadful dashboard sound indicating one of my tires is low on air. This is totally unacceptable for a normal street car. Had they sold the Fusion Sport as a Fusion RS / SVT, that might make sense, but to get a meager 0.85g lateral acceleration out of latex balloon tires in 235/40R19 is ridiculous.

I cannot go to anything thicker than 235/50 and I have to go down to 18 inch wheels. My Mustang GT had thicker tires than these, and the new 2017-2018 Mustang GTs come with 235/50R18 tires standard and look beefier than the stock Fusion Sport tires. There's not enough clearance between the tread and strut spring perch to go thicker, and I can't go to a smaller wheel because of the large front brakes. The police Fusion Hybrid has 235/50R17 tires at least.

The car itself is also fairly poorly made. I have lots of issues with the driver/passenger door modules, with the one-touch windows occasionally not working. Every Fusion sitting in the dealer lot for more than a few weeks will have a dead battery because they have yet to resolve the parasitic drain. I can tell you that there's a 18A draw when you push the ignition button to the ON mode, whereas older Fords (even my 2014 SHO) had something like 5A-7A in the same mode. There are far too many electronics in the new Fusion, and the car itself isn't all that great.

The 2.7 EcoBoost sounds great on paper, but it has severe torque limiting in 1st gear so it just bogs off the line even when powerbrake launched at 2000 RPM. I got walked and gapped badly by an EcoBoost Mustang, and the Fusion Sport has trouble passing a Silverado when the Silverado driver simply doesn't want me to change lanes. In terms of handling, there's a lot of understeer, so I don't get why Ford even bothered with these horrible tires. The SHO even in stock form would have smoked the Fusion Sport off the line.

The LED headlights don't generate any heat at the lens, so if there's ice and/or snow buildup on the lens, it will never melt off. The high beams are also LED, so there's nothing you can do short of stopping to scrape the stuff off every few miles. With halogens and HIDs, there's always some heat at the lens to melt the ice/slush off. You can thank FMVSS for this, because UNECE requires headlight washers or wipers for headlights that have LEDs, HIDs, or projectors. Basically, almost the entire world uses UNECE regulations for their vehicles except for US/Canada/Mexico who use FMVSS. So in the winter while it is snowing, the headlights will have ice buildup so potholes aren't easily spotted, and the thin profile tires will pop like balloons. Yet, the Fusion Sport isn't anywhere near as fast as something I'd consider a ""performance sedan"", so it shouldn't even need these performance tires. Even the SHO has thicker 255/45R19 or 245/45R20 tires. I don't see the Explorer Sport running rubber bands either. It's not surprising Ford axed the re-style for the Fusion just recently.

One other thing I should mention is the severe lack of headroom. I'm 6'3"" and if I lower the seat enough for proper headroom, I have to peek over the dashboard to guess at the location of the right corner of the car. With a racing helmet, I have to sit in this position and have the helmet constantly rub on the headliner of the car. Without a racing helmet, I can raise the seat to get decent forward vision but I'm about 1 mm from the headliner. It uses storage space/ergonomics better than the older D3 based Taurus but either Europeans or noticeably shorter (the Fusion is a re-badged Mondeo) or they marketed this car for women and short people exclusively. If you're around my height, I highly recommend going up to a larger vehicle or a SUV.

Overall: 1 out of 5 stars, the Fusion Sport is a shiny and expensive heaping piece of trash of a car. I wish I had kept my 2014 SHO, or went with a new 2017 SHO as the newer SHO's are updated with SYNC3 so I get the latest electronics but with a far superior car. The SHO is heavier and ""older"", but it handled much better, and the 3.5L EcoBoost is a beast of an engine when stock and just a tune can make it run 12.1-12.4 in the 1/4 mile. The SHO also had tires that could handle potholes and rocks, whereas the Fusion Sport will have a blowout just running over a kid's marble collection.",0
"Second Expedition I have owned.
The first was solid(2001) this 2008 was horrible.
100,000 miles.
I've had 2 new transmissions.
3 exhaust gaskets

2 alternators

Window slides replaced
Rust started on the hood and tailgate at 80k

"I was happy with the overall performance and maintenance.
Then I learned via the news that  VW cars spewing much more emissions into the environment than consumers were led to believe by VW because VW wanted to save a few dollars.

Buying VW is partly buying into a feeling that they are company you can trust to be good.
Since  learning that VW lied about their toxicity to the environment and denied consumers the information to make a choice consistent with their values.  My car is a 2001 and was manufactured prior to the current scandal.  But you have to wonder what did they lie about and cover up back then when there was even less scrutiny?

For that fraud and complete, willful, sustained lack of integrity  and for being a company that seems to hate the environment, and lies to consumers, I give you a one star.

$30,000 worth of warranty work done by VW to the 2015. And this is the fully loaded sel not a base model. And here I am with the collateral exchange they agreeed to a 2017 so they won't get sued. The 2017 has the same ridiculous problems. Just unexplainable problems like steering wheel rack, both axles, all electronics, windows, heated seats, water leaks. U can name every problem in the book. The 2013 was bulletproof with the 2.5 5 cylinder engine. They got rid of it because they cudnt get any more better gas mileage out of it. The 2012 was the first year with less options.

Fof d does not stand by it's products. The shift handle on this model car is bad going  back to 2011 and poses a safety hazard because it will not properly seat in park and can potentially roll. The car should be under a national recall. It appears Ford doesn't care about the danger.,0

- The radio volume will randomly pitch really loud, and when that happens, the stereo turn down dial won't work. So good times all around.
- Recently, Caesar has begun refusing to switch gears on the highway, and will just stop accelerating.

"Owned this car for 4 months.  Terrible reliability.  Car had 42,000 miles when purchased, so still had 8000 miles on factory warranty, which in theory is great until you take it in to the dealer and they refuse to fix your issues.  First issue was bad upper control arms that caused an intermittent steering wheel shake at 65-75mph.  Two trips to the dealer and pleading with the service writer to ride on the hwy with me to show him the issue before they would replace.  (I also had to pay for full balance and alignment before they would consider it anything but a tire issue).  Next was steering wheel would not return to center after low speed turns, which was never fixed as this is ""normal"".  Last straw was took it to an independent for an oil change and turns out about a quart of oil was sitting on the bellypan, being absorbed by the sound deadening material on the bottom.  Independent told me to take it to the dealer to have it repaired under warranty as it was leaking from the heads and valve cover area.  AUDI SAN FRANCISCO refused to fix any leaking, would not even acknowledge it.  All this on a car with less than 50,000 miles.  Immediately sold the car (back to an AUDI dealer) and put my wife in a Honda CRV instead.  Not worth the trouble!",0

"Pros:
- Great handling and sport mode
- AWD is great, this car won't slide
- Very comfortable interior

- Acura customer service is terrible. Acura customer care wouldn't call me back for 8 months. They also denied that may backup camera intermittently not working was an actual issue. I am willing to upgrade this review if they actually demonstrate that they can take responsibility for problems in their brand-new cars. The dealership has been more helpful, but their hands are tied by Acura.
- Electronics are a joke. The voice recognition is so bad as to be unusable. The navigation system is similar. After paying for the tech-package, I have now replaced it with an iPhone with a dash mount.
- Over-reliance on touch screens. Everything, including setting the fan speed is on the touch screen, which makes many important features too slow to get to.
- Acura has dealers separate from the OEM. These are separate entities that do not communicate. They point fingers at each other when things go wrong. My next car will be a Tesla which doesn't have dealerships and hence doesn't have this problem.",0

"I am taking the time to write this review in hopes of saving someone the agony of purchasing a jeep only to find out that it looks like a great truck but it is pure junk. Trust me do not buy a 2008 jeep wrangler.
If I was the only one with the problems I am having since new I would say its just a lemon, but please take a minute to look up the Jeep and goggle oil consumption, electrical problems or even ""death wobble."" Many Thousands of Jeep owners have had the same problems.
When I purchased my Jeep I thought I had done my homework. Consumer reports gave it the worst rating they have even given a vehicle. Check it out. The 2008 Jeep is the worst rated EVER of any car or truck. Now I knew that but the truck was new and they complained mostly about an uncomfortable ride. I figured hey its a jeep not a cadillac. Well yes its uncomfortable that that not the worst part.
The jeeps made is 08 ( can't say about other years) the engine was made in Mexico. The same they use in the mini van. It is extremely underpowered. I have a manual transmission, or I don't know how it can get out of it's own way. On a windy day top highway speed is about 70-75 and that is floored. That is still not the worst of it.
THE JEEP BURNS OIL!! Almost all 08 jeep owners complain about a quart of oil every 1000 miles. There have been tons of complaints and Chrysler says that is within the normal range. A quart every 1000 miles! everyone knows thats a joke but for them to do a recall it would be just crazy costly as the problem is the piston rings. Thats what the experts are saying. The jeep will begin tapping over time, they say its a bearing issue.
Also electrical is causing many problems for owners. I stalled out on a lone piece of Hwy and even with my key out the jeep displayed all sorts of lights. Sometimes the ABS will stay on or we can't get the high beams to lower unless we turn on the blinker.
Then there is the death wobble as scary and dangerous as it sounds. What makes me the most upset it have Jeep Chrysler handles the problem. BY DOING NOTHING!
I will never ever buy a jeep truck or car made by Chrysler. I'm not a rich person. It took a lot to purchase this jeep. It only has 38k miles but most don't get past 50 without a new engine. i'm really stuck with this.
I can do nothing except hope some else reads this and does their homework. There is tons of evidence on line.",0

DO NOT BUY JEEP and don't believe that BS about most awarded SUV ever. If not for this issue, which the company has chosen to ignore, it would be a great choice and get 5 stars.

1, the battery died
2, the starter was gone,
3, the cable connecting starter ( very thick one) broke inside, make my car won't start, and my mechanic thought it's a starter problem, make me keep changing 3 new starters at the cost of my new starter warranty, and some towing fee, and lots of time.
4, the coil was gone,
5, the radiater was gone
6, a black plastic part for cooling system gone that needs replacement, however, needs to 2-3 hours to replace it, cost around $250.
so now, I decide to try to sell it
7, the glove box lock fall apart, I decide not to open it anymore.
8, the sensor of my door locking gone, make my car alarm horn at night from time to time, battery drain again, I walk to a meeting instead of driving, the sensor is at very inside of the hinge of the door, that you cannot use a tape or something to fix it easily.

9, the electric trunk release was gone, make you have to stall the car and use a key to open trunk. ( I didn't fix it)

I find Mitsubishi cars to be absolute junk. I have had 2 Mitsubishi and both have had bad transmission. The 2003 and many other models have a know transmission issue where the clutch assembly in the automatic transmission is defective (look up service bulletin tsb0523004revII) and will start slipping and slamming into gear.

"Only two covers work, the others are not",0
"There are many issues with the car from a quality control standpoint to engineering.

  The integrates audio and climate control unit is a poor idea especially since the audio head unit is prone to have issues and failures quite often.  The 1st owner of my car had it replaced before 60k on the car and I have had issues in the cold with it where I had to keep pressing the face of it above the #3 preselect button in order to get it to show anything on the display or even work.  There are contacts on the faceplate that are an issue and why this happens.  You can separate the climate control from the audio unit as they are connected with a circuit board.

  The turbos are prone to failure because of the oil feed line filters in the union (banjo) bolts.  They get caked and then the turbo starves of oil, dies and then can take out the engine too sometimes.  On the 2008 the most important filter is under the turbo inlet hose which is a 6-8hr job to pull and reinstall.  I know because mine tore and I replaced it with a brand new Perrin hose, they aren't cheap either.  The Subaru hose is prone to failure as an FYI.  If Subaru would have engineered the turbo placement to the side of the engine in the large open space that exists then both of these items would be 100 times more easy to deal with.

  The spark plugs are a royal pain to change because in order to make it smoother you need to loosen the rear upper engine mount so that you can jack the motor up some to get the spark plug tubes above the frame rails in the engine bay.  Then an angled attachment is needed on top of extensions and other off tools to  get them in and out.  Pray that the brittle connectors to the coil packs don't break.

  The OCVs (Oil Control Valves) go bad a lot but they aren't too bad to replace except the passenger side.  For some reason a metal brace or guard is in the way and the solution is to cut it off or bend it out of the way and back, I bent it out of the way and back.

  The ECU isn't very bright.  Any change you make to the intake will require it to be reflashed(reprogrammed) in order to not run lean and blow the motor.  I don't mean loose a little MPG, I mean trash the motor.  The car runs somewhat lean from the factory and is safer after the reflash, it wasn't hard to find this information.

  There are more issues but I'm not sure how much more room I have to write.  It's just amazing that this car has been more ofna PITA than the 2001 S4 Avant I owned.  I thought that was the worst cad to work on but at least it was great sounding and great to drive.  This has been dreadful and I read that some of the poor design flaws on this car still being used these days...seriously Subaru?",0

"Vehicle is cheaply made and costly repairs have needed to be made to soon starting in 2013. Air conditioning vent issues, fuel injectors, power window actuator failed, and the catalytic converter needed to be replaced. By the way, the vehicle WAS not a salvaged or rebuilt title type of vehicle, but it I think it should have been.",0
"Purchased brand new and had problems from the beginning.  Within the first year the air conditioner had to be repaired, the steering column replaced, and the load leveling system was never actually fixed.  Even after multiple trips to the dealer for repair, the load leveling system always leaned to the left.  The final straw was the shift lever.  It failed to release the key from the ignition and according to the dealer their were no available replacements.  The expedition was at the dealer for more than two months waiting on a replacement shift lever.  Ended up having to buy a new car and selling the expedition.",0
"Some of the reasons below on why this car is one of the worst ever.
The car is falling apart after 80k miles.
The suspension is gone
Had to change the headlights 2 times
Radiator
Disc brake gone twice
Brake pads degrade too soon even the expensive one
The AC evaporator was throwing water in the cabin
The starter is having some issues
The tires sensor won't turn off
Had to change the spark plugs and wiring
Battery had to be changed 2 times
Driver windows regulator stopped working
Without reason in the summer burns all the coolant
You need a lot of room to make an u turn.

I can go forever, do not waste your money on this car and pay a little more for an Asian car. This car will be ok If it has less than 10k. Anything after that then you are singing your death sentence.",0
Disappointed in quality and support.  Major concerns:  Front differential assembly was replaced at 15649 miles for noise after several trips to dealer.  Oxygen sensors failed shortly after the extended warranty ended.  Frame rusted thru from the inside apparently in an area where certain vehicle's frames were replaced.  Vehicle had the wrong VIN number. It was supposed to only have rust in the rear.  Toyota district representative said the truck was old.,0
Typical American quality. All of the dash lights on and rusted out.,0
The box come with a hole and of course the radiator come cracked. I buy a new one already and throw away the other one . Wasting money. The delivery persona has to put more attention in the packages.,0
"Many things make this car a huge pile. My patictual car has a the worst combination of components to make it probably the worst thing bmw has made. The entire drivetrain should be thrown away, from the engine to the rear end. The car needs a diet since it weighs 4300 lbs and with its 170hp (when new) it can't even get out of its own way. It leaks water and has random electrical issues(probably caused by water damage) I've fixed alot of them but since the day ends in Y I'm sure another issue will arise.  The interior is something from the early 90s with its fake wood trim and plastic that's faded. With all the road noise and wind noise sounds like I'm driving a jeep without doors. There's not enough time in the day for me to explain all the mechanical issues that'll I've fixed and the others that still need to be fixed. If your looking to buy an older bmw make sure it's not an 323 base model. Unless you want to gut the car, drop an ls under the hood and make it a track car.",0

"The most regrettable purchase of my automotive life: $45k fully loaded SLT 4x4 Crew Cab and after 25 shop days and two major drivetrain repairs before 10k, it still clunks and lurches more than the 200k mile F150 that I traded in. If this is ""professional grade"" I want to know the profession. Beautiful cabin but it drives and shifts in a terribly discombobulated manner and passengers notice... and complain. I've spent countless hours on the phone with GM with no relief. I'd spend the extra coin for a well appointed Ford any day.",0
When I purchased the car I loved it but shortly after I paid the first payment it was steaming from under the good and the check engine light was on and it wouldn't show any codes. Needless to say I no longer own a jeep liberty,0

First $6,500.00 for a new Ford motor from Autonation in Brooksville, Fl. and 24 months later another $3,200.00 to repair the engine again and Ford states that they have never had a recall on this 5.4L engine. You can find all kind of information that people have had with this engine on the internet. As for Autonation they told me that I had a problem and to just deal with it. This is by far the worst vehicle that I have ever owned along with the worst dealer ship a ever dealt with. I should paint a big lemon on each door but I don't won't to spend any more money on this pile of  junk.",0

"Apparently I was dreaming when I thought that purchasing a 2011 Jetta would be a good idea after the lease on my 2009 Passat was up.  Don't all VW models share the same fine German engineering?  Apparently not.  The Jetta seemed like a small downgrade when I purchased it, but it was what I could afford at the time.  I guess you get what you pay for (lesson learned).  It was a huge downgrade.  Within  a month of purchase (new) I had wind noise like you could not believe coming from the driver side door.  Four trips to the dealership, and after explaining in great detail what the issue is (four times)..it has been ""fixed"".  Not really but I gave up.  The cheap bumper plug circle thing (for towing?) has mysteriously disappeared from the bumper (assuming it fell off while driving).  Drivers side seat has ripped at the seams.  Now the radio has just suddenly stopped working mid-song on the highway.  Drivers side day lamp and brake light are out AGAIN and this time replacement bulbs have not solved the problem so it is obviously electrical. AND the horn when you lock the vehicle is so obnoxiously loud that I have to wait to lock the car when no passersby are near or it will startle them.  The plan was always to give this vehicle to the teenage daughter when she got her license, but to be honest I wouldn't wish a Jetta on my worst enemy.  We bought her a Beetle and it's glorious.",0

"Ford and the 6.0 engine  builder International screwed the owners of the 6.0 diesel with very poor engineering. Bad Oil Cooler. weak head bolts ,rotten coolant,  dirty sand filled blocks weak fuel pressure spring, bad/ weak high-pressure oil seal. The list goes on and on. Once I fixed All it's faults it is not a bad truck.",0
"Paint is poor quality, Glow plugs go out every few months, DEF heater last only a few years. if they have any real problems a good scan tool (snap -on) won't even work on it. So off to the dealer for another costly bill. just to reset something. NEVER again.",0
"The truck has had to have the front brakes replaced five times and I do not tow anything with it. Also, the gas mileage is horrible, but I realized it was going to be bad when I bought the truck. The truck upkeep cost is deplorable. Whenever I take it to the dealer I always come out with a bill exceeding $500. Literally, I cannot afford to run the vehicle. I have low mileage on it, 51000 and it's only 2010, and I hope to trade it soon for another brand of vehicle, Ford or Chevy. Be wary when you buy a Ram, the upkeep will nickel and dime you to death!",0
"My 6 liter diesel is the worst thing I have ever purchased.  If I had the energy I would try and sue Ford.  Every part of my truck has broken it seems.  Between ford warranty and my after warranty expenditures , I think I am approaching the 45k cost of this truck in repairs.  Ford and the dealer stuck it to me at 95k miles by replacing the split recovery bottle and not telling me that was caused by a blown head gasket. Went back in at 104k , out of warranty , and they inform me of the $5k problem I had.  Nice  it never ends.  Never again Ford.",0
It was a plastic mirrior and it is not flat it has waves and very distorted,0

"Mine has been a complete lemon.  Leaks water around back door and roof rack, despite numerous trips to the body shop.  Head gasket leaked water into the cylinder so at about 100,000 miles, what was left of a piston, got scattered all through the engine on startup.  Replaced engine.  Replaced A/C compressor....twice.  Back heater doesn't work.  Replaced oil pump and pickup screen on first engine.  Several sensors have been replaced on various occasions.  And numerous other minor problems that has kept it in the shop for much of my ownership.  I keep it maintained but the check engine light has been on more than off.  Got another evap system leak as I type this.  Have about as much money in repairs as I paid for the vehicle initially.",0
"After 4 new Chevrolet trucks spanning the better part of 15 years, this will be my last Chevrolet truck....barring a GM 180 degree turnaround.
I have a 2016 LT Z71 crew cab (doors in back same as doors in front)
Some things...
1) The navigation system is a joke.  It doesn't have simple map GPS technology, and if you want to spend the dough and keep the on-star package, you can call in and get turn-by-turn directions.  This is just silly.
2) There is an unpredictable delay in all things electronic, ranging from the dome light coming on when opening the door (sometimes 1 sec, sometimes 2 secs, never instant like all prior vehicles).  This results in changing the radio station 2 or 3 times before realizing in fact I did press the button hard enough to change the station
3) The navigation of the electronic interface is far from intuitive.  Case in point....in November while in Colorado, I rented a Ford Expedition and was able to figure out the electronic system (including the iCar interface) in a few minutes, literally before I left the rental place.  To this day, I still cannot easily navigate the Chevy system (I've had the truck since July).  I can fumble through how to change to AM when I need to...but just silly that it takes 2-3 taps for most things, and I consider myself an ok IT user....I used to code custom language for crying out loud.
4) I've owned 4 LT1 Z71 packages in a row (this is my 4th, my last was a 2011).  Shame on me for assuming this, but many of the features that came on each of the 3 prior ones did not come with this one.  Ouch.  That one's on me....but I won't make that mistake again.  I can't fathom that a $50k truck doesn't have electronically controlled foldable mirrors, so driving in the garage isn't surgical.
5) Gas mileage is not a big deal for us, but 14.5 is what I get over 7,500 miles.  I drive about 15 miles to work each way with 2 stops and 2 slow downs along the way.  Seems like it should get better, especially when advertisements say 17 city.
6) Standard tires are pretty chincy for a truck.

The good stuff
1) Blue metallic paint looks sharp
2) Enough power
3) Like the manual shift feature....but heck, that technology has been standard on many other vehicles for 5+ years
4) Decent amount of space in the back seat.....BUT! not as much as Ford F-150 quad or whatever equal cab they call it
5) Body style is decent looking; hard to believe they didn't put a chrome front grill like Ford does, would have looked sharper IMHO.

I am so disappointed that I will have this truck for a few years.  Unless Chevy does a 180 though, this will be my last.",0
"This is my daughters car and it is the biggest money pit I have ever been a part of, what we didn't know is that ALL SUBARU'S head gaskets go bad after 100,000 miles or so and to repair it is a major money night mare, and many people try to hide the fact that this need to be done and put nasty things into the radiator to hide it.  The style and space and snow handling are very good, so beware of used Subaru's",0

Junk!!!,0
"The car was great for the first few months, perhaps the first year. However, after that, everything went downhill. Recall after recall, my alternator went out on the highway, almost killing me since the steering is electronic. I love supporting American companies and businesses, but this is my last American car. Supporting Chrysler is not worth my life. I am upgrading to a Volvo as soon as I can trick some poor guy into buying my car.",0
As an old grampa I thought this would be a great retirement car......Well no. It's way too fast and expensive for my exquisite tastes. I quickly traded this thing in for a good ole Prius. Now the Toyota Prius is an amazing car way better that Tesla's pile of crap,0

"With only 1,217 miles this car left my wife stranded.  It started, however she was unable to put in in Drive (or reverse) and several dashboard icons lite up.  We called Honda and they towed to nearest dealer.  Dealer refused to provide a loaner overnight.  Dealer indicated they disconnected battery and re-contected in order to reset onboard computer which enabled the car.  They could not find nothing wrong.  What is very sad now is each time my wife goes to turn the key she is nervous whether it will be another ""stranded moment"".  Noteworthy is the dealer said the 2016 Pilot was also having issues they ""could not figure out"".",0
"trans, radiator, alternator, valve at rear of car for emissions, 4 co2 sensors, catalytic converter, driver side window motor and only 87,000 miles, need I say more.

If it was the only car company on the planet I wouldn't even considerate it , and use shoe express. What's really horrible is I can't sell it unless I give it away.

Money hungry ride. Nothing but problem after problem noise after noise sound after sound.,0
I don't like it and I got rid of it.,0
Known issues with the fuel injectors known issues with ignition coils this vehicle should be recalled due to all the issues known with it.

Leaks from the roof that they can not fix. I would not recommend to anyone at this point.,0
"2016 Acura MDX with Advantage Package:
Thankfully it's a three year lease with slightly over a year left. Counting the months till the end.
Torque vectoring on this vehicle is great. It's activates upon acceleration and requires bit of shifting habits and relearning. Once mastered, works like a charm. This car pulls out of tight turns at speed, grips beautifully at wet surface, stays supersolid at uneven road and stays straight through deep water.
The amount of space for front row, second row and cargo is great. MDX lends itself to big shopping  trips with whole family.
As far as everything else I am shaking my head in disbelief at putrid quality. The body has uneven gaps and initially we were closing doors repeatedly, thinking they are ajar.
9 speed transmission required two visits for software updates. It works better now and that's as far as it will go. It will never be very good or responsive or smooth.
Suspension makes noises in the back. According to dealer, it's normal.
Steering wails when turned to the end. According to dealer, you guessed it, it's normal.
Brake rotors were warped at 14k miles. We were charged for repairs, it's normal wear and tear.
Brakes are pulsating again at 35k. No comment.
Climate control overrides heat/cool for the seats. If  heat is setup on automatic/sync, the seat will come on and off automatically. If seat is set manually, entire climate control goes manual. Genius, I tell you, genius. By the way, those controls, touchscreen only, two levels down from main menu. No buttons for you!
Interior is full of rattles and squeaks. Stopped chasing those after a while and just play music little louder.
This model is equipped with electronic doo-dads that are supposed make you life easier. It has for example, automatic braking, that will flash words BRAKE on windshield repeatedly, even in traffic at 30mph. This function can disabled permanently, not without ever present warning light, though.
There was a reason Acura placed 25th out of 25 brands in 2017 ACSI study. Cars like that are a reason.",0
2day delivery. Poor quality part inside a motorcraft box....not sure if part is genuine ford part.,0
I love the truck however the transmission taints that a lot. Jeep has put the weakest transmission into these and built in a safety system that will cut all power to the car as to not damage transmission and therefor not have to warranty anything. It overheats on a regular basis under normal driving conditions and no towing or large payloads yet still chrysler refuses to address this as a problem. Unless you can drive your daily routine at 40kms an hr I would stear clear of chryslers cvt transmissions in any of their vehicles.,0

Only 70,000 miles on it and it has had a miss in the engine since 35,000 miles taken it to several shops and back to the dealer but can't seem to be fixed. Spent $1200.00 for spark plugs twice.

This vehicle looks great but BMW used too many unreliable parts in an effort to save bucks I'm sure.,0

Many famous crooks claim they are jeep specialists they just loot your money.  Trust me... buy a jeep service it at the authorized dealer.,0
This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned. I've had multiple premature failures on this truck ranging from the faulty pcm to the power steering.,0
"This is a complete dumpster fire of a vehicle. Carvwas ok for the first 50,000 miles. After that I had thought the timing belt went, but that wasn't the case pulled the front of motor apart and found out that it was not the belt but the ""plastic pully"" that is used to put tension on the belt had exploded. The best part is that this is an interference engine. The motor was toast. At 55,000 miles it was sent to a junk yard. Never again chevy.",0
"Since the day I saw it.

The truck caught my eye in the parking lot of a small dealership. A small black pickup truck with minor wear and tear from manly truck use. I didn't mind. Trucks are supposed to be rough and tough, not necessarily pretty in my opinion. I did get a decent deal. A 2004 GMC Sierra 1500 SLT 2WD Ext. Cab 4.8L v8. 168,000 Miles.

As I inspected the truck, it seemed to have no issues other than minor cosmetic, but two weeks after purchasing the truck, two things happened; the engine light came on and the dash board would momentarily stop working. Alright, no big deal. Engine light was caused by a fuel evaporative leak. Could be a cheap fix, but I have not found where the leak is from, yet. It is not the fuel cap. With the dashboard, the gauges would ""zero-out"" while the vehicle is in motion and stay reading ""0"" for approximately 10 seconds a time. This happened almost every time I drove the truck. Possible causes: cluster or ignition. No resolution found. A couple of months later the dashboard completely stopped working and all the gauges froze on random readings and the dash board has remained frozen since then. Another thing that happened a couple of weeks after purchasing truck was an oil leak coming from the oil pan.

I really wanted to like my truck, but now I do not feel comfortable buying another GMC/Chevrolet truck of this generation model. Taking the truck to a mechanic prior to purchase should have been my priority. I noticed that these are not uncommon problems with this truck either, but many others have had good luck with these trucks. My truck is also of a higher milage than many others. I did not expect a new truck out of an old one. I simply wanted to speak out my frustarations.",0
"i have the cx and bought it used, very glad i got the warranty. Have had to replace head gaskets, brake lines, coil springs, brakes and wheel bearings (twice),Gas tank, heater control mod, all of this within the 30,000. mile warranty now it is over heating this summer. I would not recommend this Buick version of the Aztec to anyone. and since this is a 2 wheel drive model did i mention how rotten it is in the snow. it now has 114,000 miles on it LOL Now the ignition key had to be replaced and the transmission is going the resale of this piece of junk has dropped to $500.00  the design of this auto is poor to say the least the radiator went bad last month also i just can not wait to see what want to fall apart next what a junker.",0

"Loved this car...the transmission blew with only 64,500 miles on it...essentially totaling it. I went up the corporate chain with VW and they could not have cared less. This car was maintained like clockwork exclusively at VW dealerships. I will never buy another VW ever again.",0

"While initial build quality is high you see it fall off very quickly.  Chrysler built things to fail in their system.  The splitter for the heater hose, valves, EGR, and many other parts.  They wanted it to look nice but they didn't want it to last.
Mine was bought new, maintenance was always done on time and correctly using only the highest quality parts.  When possible don't buy the Chrysler parts.  You'll get much better quality by not having factory parts.
So far I've replaced the head gasket twice, valve cover gasket 1 additional time, EGR, all heater hose in the engine bay, radiator, water pump, alternator, belt 3 times, front right caliper when it locked up, parking brake line, spark plugs twice, flashed the ECU, and battery leads.
Valves sound like crap and transmission whines in first and second.  I'll be replacing it soon I'm sure.",0
"1999 Durango SLT 5.9L Magnum 4WD. All leather all the options you'd want.

This is one of the worst vehicles I've ever owned. Something else broke every week. Most of it is made of cheap plastic that is ridiculously priced (like $48 for a button that lasts about a year). Felt like the seats were made of wood. 10mpg. Highway, city, 2WD, 4WD, doesn't matter. 10mpg or less. Traded it for a Ram 1500 4WD 5.9L Magnum, same gas mileage, but, it's much more comfortable, and this one doesn't break down once a week.",0

"Mazda USA has a problem with both the truth and accepting responsibility. When mine developed front suspension problems that lead to a catastrophic ball joint failure, with a wheel falling off, Mazda USA denied any responsibility. Repairs were over $2,300 (at an independent shop) and there was an additional $1,800 in body damage from the wheel separating (which I never had done). I paid out of poket
Fast forward 18 months later and lo and behold, they have a full fledged recall. I applied, they offered reimbursement for the bad parts replaced. I declined and submitted an appeal, which was denied (after 2nd recall). Then I got another recall notice, for the replacement parts I had put in with the initial repair. I had my local dealer perform that recall replacement.

Bottom line - even on a safety issue, Mazda USA will do the bare minimum when forced to. Had they stepped up, owned it and done the right thing, I'd probably feel a little bit differently.",0

Nissan won't issue a RECALL on this transmission. I'm not the only person that had this problem. So 18 months left on paying on this car loan and I am forced to buy another  vehicle because to replace this transmission it will be $3300.00. Nissan just lost a valued customer.

Engine is loud at over 3800 RPM, and underpowered, which in turn fuel economy suffers due to its heavy weight, averaging 15MPG city/highway combined. The only plus is the interior space.

This vehicle has had 4 front end alignments before 50k miles. The A/C coil developed a leak and the repair was over $1200. Then 1 month later the coil was recalled but because I had over 36k miles I could not be reimbursed. This is my last new GM product for my family.,0

Jeep is a death trap... Chrysler killed more of their drivers than any other car company. 3 years in a row their fuse box was recalled. The car shuts off by itself or would not shut off.

"Big Horn, 6 cylinder

Pros: Aesthetically pleasing. Good power and decent gas mileage for a 6 cylinder on such a big frame.

Cons: Top heavy ride, cheap OEM parts. Bulky. Rough transmission shifts. Oil filter in a horrible location. High mount break light leaks water when gasket wears out. If you're getting this truck, just go ahead and replace it before your truck smells like mildew - very common problem. Tires wore out fast. I couldn't reach to the other side of the truck; if I needed to close the air vent I would have to stop the car. Bad dealerships. Doesn't hold value.

After about 45,000 miles its performance drastically decreased, ride was uncomfortable and a variety of problems started to occur.
Dealership too incompetent or dishonest to diagnose issues causing me to never purchase a Chrysler vehicle again. Sold it while it still has some value and went to Toyota. Couldn't be happier.",0

"Bought my 2011 Jetta brand new from a VW dealership!! Boy have I had the same problems it seems as everyone else has with their Jettas!! The day I drove my Jetta off the lot back in 2011 i noticed my car pulled to the right- took it in to the dealership and after 4 attempts to have it fixed, they finally told me that the front end of my vehicle was incorrectly made! About a year later I noticed that when I went to try and then my car off the key was sticking in the on position in the ignition-  forcing me to attempt to shut my vehicle off several times before it would actually turn off! After two years of that, one day my vehicle would not turn off! I couldn't get the key yet again to turn back to the off position! After 6 hours of trying, my husband and I gave up. Called VW towing assistance and they told me they were unable to come out and assist me because my car wouldn't turn off, therefore it was a hazard and they would be unable to tow! My husband finally pulled the fuel fuse and once the vehicle was off, I had it towed! Mind you it was months after my warranty expired, therefore it cost me $300 for a new key and another $700 for a new ignition/motherboard! A month after that my battery was dead, replaced the battery! Two weeks after the battery was replaced my indash radio (that came with the car stock) suddenly stopped working, and has not turned on since! Was quoted by a VW dealership that it would cost $700-$800 to replace my three year old stereo!! Shortly after that, my cruise control quit working! Followed by the horn randomly not working when locking the vehicle! I have no clue as to why all of these things seem to happen with this year make and model! Hoping for a stereo recall!!",0

"Worst reliability. Nearly a dozen recall items. This car started falling apart the 1st month we had it new from the dealer. Too many problems to list, but here are a few:

1. Steering rack is known to have problems. Had to be replaced 90 days into the car.
2. Goes through an entire set of motor mounts every 30,000 - 35,000 miles. Dealer explained this is simply normal for the viscous motor mounts that the Enclave uses. ($800/instance)
3. Had to replace the entire front axle (both half shafts) at 75,000 ($1,200) Dealer says this is normal.
4. Passenger mirror had to be replaced since motor stopped retracting it (warranty at 40,000). Now the paint on the replacement is flaking off because it was painted so poorly by the body shop at the dealer.
5. Cooling system in seat had to be replaced (warranty at 40,000)
6. Brake rotors are too small for the weight. Front ones warped. $180 to plane. Will fade to the point of not working if used for more than 20 minutes coming down from mountains - even with transmission assist. Dealer says this is normal.
7. Front control arm bushings have to be replaced every 30,000. Dealer says this is normal.
8. All 4 wheels had to be replaced since the chromed plastic facia glued to the (optional luxury 20"") steel wheel cracked along each spoke of every wheel (warranty at 35,000)
9. Air Conditioning Condensor went out at 70,000. $900
10. Brake Master Cylinder and booster went out at 60,000. $820
11. Vinyl trim around front window cracking. $400
12. Battery is good for 24 months.

Dealer told me it's only a matter of time before the timing chain stretches and will need to be replaced at $3,500.

$51,000 spent for a top-of-the-line CXL in 2010. What a rip off. Stay away from Buick for sure!",0
Just a horrible problem filled vehicle,0
"I loved my Accord when I first got it, and for the first 80,000 miles. Then Honda sent me a recall notice for my automatic transmission. I researched the recall and I found that there was a problem with the 2nd gear cooling system. The recall instructions were as follows:
1) Vehicles with less than 15,000 miles received a special ATF oil jet kit, which was installed on a fluid return line. This kit was designed to prevent the problem by injecting cooled transmission fluid directly onto the second gears. 2) If the vehicle had more than 15k miles, the dealer would inspect the gears and either install the jet kit, or install an entire remanufactured transmission.
Mine had more than 15k miles and my dealer told me my transmission had no discoloration, and installed the jet kit. Shortly thereafter, my transmission failed. Most specifically, my second gear failed. I was told I needed a new transmission. I complained to my dealer, that this was the exact problem described in the recall, and then had to escalate to the Honda regional representative. Eventually the rep agreed to pay for half my repair. If the failure had been anything else but second gear, I would have not complained, but the coincidence was too great for me to let it go. I really feel that Honda did not properly take care of their customers on this recall. From the numerous complaints that I have read on the web, Honda just decided to let many of their customers bear the brunt of the defective transmissions. I can only hope that this is not a normal thing for Honda.",0
Grossly overpriced. Horrible resale! Ended up $8000 upside down. Marginal reliability.  BMWs aren't  what they used to be. Better choices out there.,0
"In comparisson to my former 1999 Wrangler, the 2008 Wrangler is aweful! It seems as though Jeep traded in quality for... I don't even know what the trade was for, but quality isn't there anymore. Everything they could get away with was switched from metal to plastic. Most notably the inner windshield. It used to be just metal, but now Jeep covers a cheeper, less attractive construction design with a plastic cover. Also, the role bars have a smaller diameter, which would look aweful if it weren't for Jeep covering that as well with--you guessed it--more plastic (with canvas covers, but the plastic is there to make the bars look bigger--another quality sacrifice. The fenders are also completely plastic now (they used to have small plastic flares, but now it's completely plastic).  They redesigned the way the roof latches on the windshield, which is now less secure and more prone to leaking. Jeeps are notorious for issues, but they are easy to work on so many issues can be fixed in the driveway with some tools and a Haynes manual. However, many of the issues my 2008 had were beyond my abilities and had to do with the electronics. Not to mention the engine kicked the bucket and needed to be replaced at just under 100k miles. Don't buy a 2008!! If you can, stick with the JK models, they are the best. I only got rid of mine because the frame rotted. I almost made it to 200k with the original engine!",0

I checked on the internet and found they had a service bulletin in 20010 reference the rear axle bearing failing, and they had a kit to replace the defecting bearing.  The truck looks like a new truck and never has been off road.
  Even though this was a manufacturing fault Toyota would not make  it good or help me financially.  It cost me $1300 to get it fixed. The people at Toyota that I talked to acted like they didn't even care that I had to pay for a problem that twas there fault.  I am not the only one that had the same problem.

"I own a 2016 Highlander Limited AWD.  JBL / Entune system and navigation systems is absolutely terrible.  Had selling dealer (by threatening Toyota with a lemon lawsuit) to insulate door panels due to extreme bass distortion and rattles...even with volume half-way up and the bass controls down to its lowest setting.  After insulating with Dynamat the door skins and inner plastic panels, the stereo is now accepatable (the selling dealer paid an third-party to do the work).  Just so you know, I had Toyota's regional sales engineer and service director look at the problem...and its inherent in ALL the Highlanders equipped with the JBL system.  We reproduced the same identical problems with other vehicles on the dealer's lot.  The Entune Navigation system is one big joke...even the service managers at two different dealers (both selling dealer and one near where I work) said so in confidence...mentioned they save all the new technology for Lexus.  Over 1/4 of the time, the nav system gives the wrong directions...I absolutely hate it!  The map graphics look like an old 1980's Atari gaming system...very antiquated.  I now use my iPhone with Google Maps for navigation.  Expect 18 MPH all-around driving mileage. Don't make the same mistake and do what I did by purchasing based on so-called ""quality"" reputation!  If you are thinking of buying a Toyota...check and recheck everything...rent the car for a few days...even if you have to pay for it.  You can't depend on Toyota ""carte blanche"" quality.  So far, no engine or other mechanical problems with 17K on the odometer. Overpriced for what you get.  I've had German cars for the past 20 years. Yes, after about 5 years the maintenance is costly, but at least they are built solid like a brick...the Toyota is like a tin can.  I close the door on the Highlander and the metal makes a waving motion because its so thin.  Very disappointed and will more than likely trade in.",0

Worse Car I ever Owned. Seems like every month something new is wrong with it. I get that it is a 16 year old car but I have seen older Honda's more reliable then this car. 1 month power steering pump went out so I changed it. Next month water pump went out so I changed that also. Then Radiator went out so I changed it then alternator So changed. Then after I changed that I kid you not the same day the wheel started humming so I thought I must have Effed something up so after inspecting it turns out that the hub bearing went bad so I changed that then a week later My alternator went out again turns out my antifreeze reservoir had a crack in it and was spraying antifreeze into the alternator causing it to short out. Now 4 months later the starter went out and after changing it the transmission is now slipping so I did a fluid and filter change on it and the slipping got worse so I'm guessing its either a torque converter or tranny is fried so 16 year old car I aint putting another dime in it. I'm trading it in for a Honda and I will never own anything Chevrolet again,0

"Seriously, who gave this car such great reviews?  We bought ours new in 2003 and it was ok until about 85K miles.  Since then it just fell apart.  I've put about $6,000 into it in the last 3 years just to keep it running.  And it still runs like s***.  Every year I fight with the ""check engine"" light at inspection time and pray that it stays off long enough for me to get a sticker.  It won't keep any coolant in the engine and I've looked every where for a leak - there is none.  Where the hell does all the coolant go???  And I never have to change the oil because it burns through 4-quarts every two months.  You hit the gas and the beast shakes like a dragon being woken up from a long slumber.  The transmission shifts when it gets around to it, not when you need it to.  Oh, and for the past two years it smells like there's gas leaking from the back.  Is there a leak though?  Mechanic can't find one so we just live with that horrid smell.  Hunk of s***.  Last week, finally, one of the coil springs broke and the mechanic told us there's too much under carriage rot to repair it.  It's finally on it's way to the junk yard, where it belongs.  It doesn't even have a lot of miles on it.  Only 128K.  That's nothing, I drive all my cars to 200K+ miles.

This Toyota Camry has been a piece of junk from day one.,0
"I give this one star only because of the model and engine that this car is. It's a convertible with a 2.4l engine.

The rear window on the convertible top will (and has) come loose from the vinyl as the top ages and shrinks. There is no fixing it besides getting a new top installed at more than the car is worth in Kelly Blue Book. The increased tautness of the top will also eventually break the latch (which it did in mine) and render the top unable to open without being drilled apart.

Additionally, the weather stripping will never seal correctly, even if replaced with new stripping, causing leakage when raining inside the cabin.

But wait, there's more...

The 2.4l engine is one of the worst designs by GM. There are two plastic fittings for the coolant system that will deteriorate and need to be replaced semi-frequently. Of which, one is located below the exhaust manifold making it very cumbersome to reach.  (Took me approx 10 hours to replace the heater hoses, which includes this part).

The Thermostat is located on the back side of the engine at the bottom, also extremely cumbersome to reach for replacement.

The water pump is driven by the timing chain mechanism, meaning if the pump were to ever go out, the timing chain would need to be replaced and the car would need to be re-timed correctly or it could wreck the engine when reinstalling. The pump also requires the exhaust manifold to be removed as well as the timing mechanism in order to replace it.

The rear o2 sensor is also located under the exhaust manifold.

The twin cam housing gaskets will leak (oil), needing to be replaced semi-often. This includes removing the timing chain housing as the cam covers are anchored inside there.

The ignition control module is located on top of the engine, sitting between the twin cams. It receives very little ventilation and will eventually grow brittle from the intense heat which will cause a hairline crack in the plastic resulting in spark seepage which causes rough idling and misfires and will need to be replaced.

The tail light sockets used in these cars will periodically stop functioning and require replacement, even if the light bulb itself is new.

Pros: Alternator, Tensioner pulley, A/C Compressor, Starter, Ignition control Module, Blower Motor and Resistor are relatively easy to  DIY replace.",0

"What can I say Detroit really dropped the ball on this POS. I've had an 1981, 1995, 2003 and now this worthless suburban. Where to begin, this thing drinks oil like no tomorrow, it's a known issue and GM plays dumb when it's brought to their attention. The canister vent valve design was horrible, so bad that it fills up with rocks and sand and you will have to replace it before you hit 95k miles or you won't be able to fill it up, again another issue GM is well aware of and offers no help other than ""you can replace it with the new redesigned version"".  Factory fuel pressure regulator was moved to the fuel pump forcing you to replace the fuel pump if it quits. A marvel of engineering for sure, move a $5 part to the fuel tank where, if you work on your vehicles yourself, you're better off to replace the fuel pump instead of dropping the tank again when it fails.
Every check engine light is somehow tied the stablitrack or the traction control. My vehicle developed a misfire due to old plug wires, but the stablitrack quit working at the same time. Fixed the misfire and the stablitrack started working again, go figure. When the canister vent valve failed the traction control quit functioning,  fix the vent valve and traction control worked again. Who in Detroit does the QC on this crap?
Needless to say this will be my last suburban, I will either buy used ones older than 2007 or buy a Ford. Stay away from an 07 suburban if you value your sanity.",0

Poor engine design and heads! This vehicle is made poorly when it comes to the engine. Blown two motors and cracked the heads 3 times and its all do to poor engine design and the fact this motor is partially made in china and Canada! Lack of oil pressure not oil amount caused most of these issues. The heads cracking caused by orange dex-coolant and not using the traditional green. Dex-cool is more corrosive !

"This car has known manufacturing defects that Nissan fails to recognize.  Do yourself a favor and look up ""2003 Altima precat"" and ""2003 Altima floorboard"".  If you own this car with the 2.5L engine and either hasn't failed yet, be weary.

First, the passenger side floorboard rusted out.  There is a known defect where water collects between two pieces of metal at the seam and rusts it from the inside out.  The entire bottom was still undercoated and my floor board rusted out.  This shouldn't happen to a car that has been taken care of and isn't that old.  I don't live on the rust belt, but looking at my floorboard in my attached picture, you would think that I did.

Second, this car has a known issue for failure of the pre-cat on the 2.5L 4-cyl engines.  Nissan recalled a select number of these cars for this issue, but failed to do so on a wide scale, even though the failing part had the same part number/manufacturer.  My issue started as a misfire in cylinder #3.  By process of elimination and research online, it was determine that the precatalyst had failed.  The failure of the pre-cat causes catalytic converter material to be sucked into the engine during the negative cycle and will ruin your piston rings.  In other words, it's like adding sand to your oil.  You can see in my pictures, the spark plug with the misfire, the precat material that had fallen to the bottom of the exhaust manifold, and the gritty sand-like material that made it's way into my engine oil.

The car above was purchased new by my wife in 2003 and only has 76,000 miles on it.  With the consistent maintenance and care we put into this vehicle, there is no reason why we should have experienced the problems outlined above.  Fortunately, I was able to repair the floorboard myself and caught the failure of the precatalyst in the nick of time and repaired it before it could wreak havoc on my engine.  If I didn't have the know-how to repair these issues, it would have cost me thousands of dollars at a body shop and mechanic.  If you are considering purchasing one of these cars, especially with the 2.5L engine, I strongly suggest inspecting the floors and having a compression test done prior to purchase.  For me, this is the last Nissan I will ever own.",0

Replaced the Ball joints, like all GM's
TPMS sensors are always out of whack.
This truck rusts in the rear quarter panels above the rear plastic bumper.
The front black clip that hangs down from the front plastic bumper flew off after bumping those parking lot concrete pads.
Do not press the indoor light button too hard in the ceiling light. My little 7yr old Daughter pressed it, and it snapped inside itself
The rear defrost cable on the right side likes to separate from the rear window.
I get about 10-12 MPG on highway driving. Had the fuel sensors checked out, and they stated everything was working fine.
So not sure about the lousy gas mileage.
the controls for my rear power windows in the back stopped working at around 130K.

This truck is a lemon, I am sure. But this is what happens when you buy used.  I tried to sell it, but no one wants to buy these unless they are really low in price.

Buyer beware.",0
The 5.4 triton engine is TERRIBLE!!! Google the motor problems before you buy one.,0
This is the biggest piece of crap car we have ever owned. It has had so many electrical issues it is ridiculous. The dodge dealer cant even figure out one of them. We have put 4 sets of tires and 4 sets of brakes on it. it does not shift down so driving in the snow is impossible. Horrible car!!! We will never buy another dodge!!!,0
Total lemon.,0
Bought new. Has had problems from day 1. Major problems starting at 70K. Has frequent major problems and is now at 130K. Poor quality.,0
"Dash cracks, sensor faults, oil consumption and lifter failures.  More has broken on this truck since I bought it than broke on my 1995 c1500 in the 16 years I drove it.  Avoid the 2007.5 to 2013 GMC/Chevy trucks.  This will be my last GM vehicle.",0

"Be very careful buying a used Toyota from this era especially (1997-2008) unless it has pristine oil change records from the DEALER!  The engine (4 or 6 cyl) could be running great, the the oil light will come on and your car is toast from sludge. The hard, crumbly, sticky deposits clog oil passages and actually prevent pumped oil from the head returning to the pan. There will be low oil on the dipstick even if the engine is overfilled with oil, hence the oil light.  If you're considering buying one anyway, at least get the valve cover pulled so you can check for the sticky mess.  I wish someone had warned me!  I mean, what could go wrong? It's a Toyota!",0
"Worst purchase of my life. Bought a 1.8T used with 90k miles, and didn't make it to 100k before the engine gave. In between, I also replaced control arms for both front wheels, the oil pan, the water pump, and the timing chain, but unfortunately it didn't help. I sold it to a friend who is a VW enthusiast afterward, and after he rebuilt the engine, the transmission failed. I won't be buying another VW product.",0
"Worst vehicle I have ever owned. It started with with a non-working stereo from day one and the dealer needed four weeks to get the replacement part shipped to him. Does nobody in the factory or before handing over the vehicle check the stereo? Next thing was an absolutely loud and annoying brake squeal for months which needed four visits to the dealer before they finally fixed it. I thought I was driving a freight train instead of a 60 thousand dollar car. The car rattles over bumps in various places, when the dealer tried to fix this they made some rattles worse than before and placed black fingerprints all over the trim. I lost a big plastic part from the underside while driving 50 miles an hour Dealer said some thieves wanted to steal this part, that's why it was loose Volkswagen dealers are the worst Ive ever encountered The car had 2000 miles on it at this moment and no off road driving ever. Various panels and parts on the car don't fit together the way you expect for this class of car, the clearance of the same parts is different in every corner of the car...

The car tells me start stop failure and transmission failure every 10 days or so, dealer cant find anything Transmission doesnt shift as smooth as you would expect for this class of car.

I also hope the lawsuits leads to a buyback for this car. If not I will sell this piece of crap and VW/Audi will never ever see me again. Will go for Lexus instead.",0

BAD FUEL MILEAGE,0
Ford is cheaper and gets better gas mileage and has more horse power,0
I bought my Tacoma brand new last July. I Have not had the truck a year yet and it has already been in the shop for a month. It has been recalled for a leaky rear differential. I have talked to corporate at Toyota and they say it could be another month in the shop before its fixed. Maybe even longer. They also told me that I was lucky because some Toyotas that had an airbag recall have been in the shop over a year now and they have no idea when they will fix that problem. In the meantime they gave me a rental corolla. I can not enjoy my boat as I cant use it. I can't do house repairs because I have no way to get materials home. My truck is going down in value as it ages and I am paying for a Tacoma and driving a Corolla. I hope to get it back soon. It will have been in the shop at least 2 months within the first 12 months I have owned it. Toyota has made it clear that they do not care about my problems and refuse to give me a time my truck will be ready. I was so excited to buy this truck which is my first Toyota but now I am sad because I am paying way too much to be driving a Corolla.,0
"Overall, it has had a lot of problems. Window regulators, a/c system issues,alignment problems, rear main seal leaking (already been replaced twice and now leaking again! !),electrical problems.",0
"I purchased the Sylvania H11 Silver star Ultra High Performance  Halogen Headlamp bulb.  I selected it because of it's better  peripheral vision feature and I live in the mountains where wildlife are frequently on the side of the roads and difficult to see.

"It's a great car, when nothing is broke. I've done all the right things, bought all top of the line oem parts and this thing refuses to run well. I've sunk nearly what I paid for the car into repairs. Not to mention the premium gas and synthetic oil.

"I will never buy a Jeep product again.  I have more problems with this car than I can count.  Currently this car has less than 20k miles and I spend so much time in the shop that I am almost at the point of swapping Christmas cards with the dealer I spend so much time there.  I have a 2008 Prius with over 80k miles and I have to think about which exit to take to find the dealership when it needs service.  I never off-road the car but things are failing that you would never think a car that has had such good care would have.  I guess it wouldn't be so bad if I could get anything fixed the first time I took it to the dealer.  While I realize some would say that isn't really the cars issue but the dealer, I would suggest that if I take it to an authorized Jeep dealer and they take two to three trips to repair some things something is wrong with the car design as well.  Currently I have a leaking gas filler tube that has been in 3 or 4 times.
As to the car, it handles like any top heavy car where anything over 80 miles per hour gives you no confidence in how the car is going to handle.  And on top of that Jeep found a way to both have poor gas mileage and poor acceleration.  Maybe it is that little tiny 4 cylinder engine they put in the car.  The one and only saving grace for this car is driving in the snow which it does pretty well.  Since I live in Southern California that isn't a great selling point.  And the car has had it's share of recalls.  Sorry I traded in my old Toyota truck on this junker.  As soon as I can afford it this baby is leaving my driveway forever!",0

"Evil piece-of-shit. Went in countless times for cooling issues, got something different replaced every time. Overheated and cracked the block at 103K miles. Just ridiculous. Went through a harmonic balancer, Ford redesigned the part because they knew the original design was faulty, but didn't bother extending the warranty or even issuing a TSB. V6 sounded like an old wheezy truck engine and made almost half as much power. V6 models were also equipped with inferior transmissions and rear ends, making any kind of serious power upgrade a no go without doing the rest of the driveline. The car that killed my Ford lust. Not even the GT40 can bring me back after this.",0

"I purchased the 2014 Charger R/T 5.7 two months ago. It was used with 9K miles. The consumer reports scores were very high for this year Charger and that was the main reason for my purchase. I had the car a week when it became apparent there was a horrendous smell coming out of the vents into the cabin. It turns out the evaporator core was contaminated with mold .I brought it to the Dodge dealer in Countryside Illinois where they said nothing was wrong and they refused to repair it. Persistence resulted in them performing a foam injection treatment which did nothing. Subsequent visits resulted in more denials. They refused to repair the problem. I filed a complaint with Dodge customer care and the Charger has been parked in the Dodge Dealer service department for weeks awaiting replacement of the evaporator core.

The reason for this review is to bring attention to the poor customer care and the issues that are prevalent in this vehicle. I have learned that many 2014 Dodge vehicles were flood damaged prior to being titled. Dodge decided to ship these vehicles to various parts of the country where they were released for sale to the public.",0

Long story short: Everything electrical had a problem and no one we took it to could figure it out.

"Ive had a lot of problems with this car, power port in front quit working, dealer said needs to be rewired. The battery and two other electrical systems failed. When the battery quit the Evapritive Purge Valve quit working, then the HVAC motor quit, I replaced the parts except power port myself for about half of the diagnostic fees ( fees about $400, and wanted about $1,200 altogether for their fix) dealership run some other tests and replaced the water pump. Last week they replaced the thermostat housing and third gear in transmission quit working so they installed a new manual transmission. Today Sunday 1-21-18 the Hydrolic clutch slave cylinder may have failed, it does not disingage clutch and clutch pedal stays on the floor. I got stuck in line at a stoplight. Figured out I needed to turn car off put in gear then start it- go fast enough to change gear without clutch and start over till I got to interstate Hwy a few blocks away so I could get home 175 miles away. I asked dealership to inspect clutch disk I installed when it had about 65K miles. When they serviced the master and slave cylinder, dealership said the flywheel was damaged as well. The clutch assembly is not covered under warranty only the transmission. I got a whole new clutch assembly. The shifter linkage retainer came off a month ago. Stores don't sell a replacement linkage retainer, dealer part only. I used a piece of a plastic shopping sack to keep bushing in and a rope to keep linkage cable on shifter arm together. I neglected to have the intake manifold replaced under warranty, a valve in intake was not working properly, and an actuator arm that controls it came off and I put it back on but it keeps coming off warranty is now out I did set an appointment to get it fixed by dealership prior to millage cap but I thought I had it fixed...

"Yes, it was old when I purchased it, but it most definately had not held up as one would expect. Owned it for about a year before it really showed it's character. The interior started falling apart, plastic parts disintegrating, liners coming off. Door panels coming loose.

My dissatisfaction was never more complete than when the water pump failed. Simple driveway job on most cars. Not so with the Jetta. You actually have to remove one of the engine mounts to accomplish this task. Fortunately I found an honest mechanic to do the job, for only about $400. Other estimates ranged up to $1200.

Ultimately the Jetta died about 18 months later when that same engine mount just collapsed. My son was driving the car and the engine literally fell out. Well half way out.

I would not consider owning one without a comprehensive warranty and service plan. They are over engineered and under manufactured.

Regrettably the minimum score is one star. Would prefer to give it a half.",0

"For what it is, it's a great vehicle.  Let's face it, folks...this isn't a rock crawling beast of a machine that strikes fear in the hearts of Prius owners.  Actually, this is a well made 4cyl small Jeep SUV that feels right at home on gravel roads, or roads less traveled by most.  The FD1 system, when paired with the 6speed Auto-stick, has nearly as much low end as the FD2, and most folks will never need it.  It's more than enough vehicle to get me where I need to be.

The interior is made with lower end plastic pieces with some fitment issues, but it's great at the price point.  Standard equipment could be better, but at this price point, it's good.

Since buying mine in September of 2016, the only alterations I've done is upgrade the speakers and add a rear parcel cover.  Nothing other than basic maintenance has been done, and I'm closing in on 10K miles.  One oil change has been performed.

****EDIT****

After 17 months of ownership, and less than 17,000 miles, my vehicle spent multiple months in the Jeep Service Department.  Jeep was unable to correct a problem in the electrical system that caused the seat belt lights and chimes to go off, even though they were in use and properly connected.  I ended up contacting an attorney, and Jeep purchased the Compass back under the Lemon Law...it took nearly 6 months from first call to the attorney to when it was finalized.

This was the worse vehicle purchase I've ever had...and I owned 2 Yugos back in the late 1980's.  I no longer look upon the Yugo as a piece of junk...that spot honor goes to the Compass.

Stay away from this vehicle.  If I could give less than one star, I would, but I'm stuck to giving it at least one under Amazon's rules.",0

"2008 Impala (used-purchased in 2012) started out great, but 2 years into owning the car it started to shut off as I was driving. I almost died two times in this car. The car shut down on the highway,on local roads, left turns, right turns,at stop signs and while parking. I once had to drive this car home by turning it off and on at the stop signs. I took the car to the dealer after each incident.  I spent over $6000 fixing the  problem that no one could figure out, until a recall was issued by GM/Chevy. Still waiting to be reimbursed by Chevy/GM, submitted my paperwork, but won't hold my breathe. If you plan to buy this car, make sure that all of the recall issues were taken care of first.  Coming to a dead stop on a highway (after the dealer tells you the car is fixed) is terrifying. I'm stuck with it for another year. I would give the car a 1/2 star if possible.",0

"The notorious 6 point oh-hell-no.  At first, I loved that truck.  That feeling lasted about 6 months until I experienced my first failure, the fan clutch.  It wasn't long after that the ICP sensor went out, leaving me stranded.  The following 5 years were plagued with many various failures, most of which are common among the 6.0 diesel owners community.  Those failures ranged from injectors to sensors to the turbo blowing up on the emissions dyno.  I traded it in for whatever the dealer would give me ($4500), and happily moved on to a Duramax.  If you're considering buying a 6.0 due to price point, seriously do yourself a favor and get a Cummins or a Duramax.  The 6.0 will kill your bank account and knuckles, but on the bonus side you'll gain a LOT of mechanic experience and probably pick up some new tools in the process.",0

Worst car I have ever purchased. I have replaced almost every conceivable part in it. Has cost me thousands and thousands in repairs. Should have gotten rid of it long time ago. I think it was a total lemon when I purchased it. It was even made in Mexico I found out.,0
"Worse new vehicle I've ever owned even with a free, dealer provided, 10 year, 100,000 mile, bumper to bumper warranty. Complaints:

1. Complete fail on automatic transmission design. The dealership had to replace the original transmission at 27,000 miles. Total of 4 transmission replacements before the warranty ran out in 2016. Current transmission has less than 7,000 miles on it & its starting to go bad. The vehicle currently has less than 60,000 miles on it & has had 5 transmissions go bad.

2. Horrible gas mileage at less than 15 mpg city & 20 mpg on the highway.

3. Over a dozen recalls on everything from multiple airbag systems to brake issues & others.

4. Vehicle alternator bearings froze twice requiring vehicle to be towed in to have it replaced.

5. A/C system failed on multiple occasions finally resulting in entire A/C system being replaced by the dealership.

Go buy a reliable vehicle that doesn't require a 10 year bumper to bumper warranty to keep it on the road.",0
"Bad EGR valve-- GM called it an upgrade so they didn't recall.
Burns oil and has been babied by grandparents it's whole life including regular scheduled oil changes at dealership.
Junk. Would never buy another Chevy.",0
Don't buy Lemon car. Got brand new. It's awful,0
This truck was a lemon from the first day I owned it. The dealership and Honda were the worst I have ever dealt with on a new truck or car. Will NEVER deal with Honda again.,0
"Its Crap. I have had nothing but trouble with it. I wish I still had my 2005 ram. That truck had 180,000 miles on it & the only things that had to be done was the routine maintenance. So if your in the market for a new truck..... don't get a Dodge, any year after 2008 is crap.

To add an end note all the trucks I have owned have always been Dodge but the 2011 will be the last.",0
"Nissan left a lot to be desired when they made the 2010 Titan. The truck is good off road, drives comfortably and the overall feel of the Titan is what a truck of that size should be. But they missed the mark with the rear end, the electronic locking dif, the entire suspension, the window motors, the engine, the interior, the brakes, the semi-gated console shifter and most definitely, the Rockford Fosgate audio system. The Titan has great power on the lower RPM range, after that, forget it. Highway driving is a chore for the 5.6 V8 as it is chrisp through the gears but after that, it bogs down once its put into Drive. The audio system is HORRIBLE. The speakers back at volumes above 11 even with the bass on level 2. The sub is below par and it performs like a cheap knock off from eBay. The brakes are like that of a cheap econo box car. They squeak and squeal after an hour or so of regular driving, let alone heavy footed driving. The interior feels plastic and cheap. The suspension rattled and makes noises. It catches every single small bump in the road. Off road it performs good, but with my model being a PRO-4X, I expected a lot more. Im countinuly let down with this truck.",0
I bought the truck used 30th miles on it. It has 178th miles now on it. I had to replace the drive shaft three time before 90th miles rear end once before 100th miles. It is a four wheel drive had to replace the four wheel hubs at 35th miles. Went to have a tune up it was 500.00 dollars because ford tack welded the spark plugs in? The last truck I sold had 396th miles on it I take care of my vehicles'. I do not know if I just got a lemon or what because I know a lot of people that own F150 and had good luck,0
I read and then dismiss ads like this.,0
Nowhere near what I expected.  Instead of 2 custom fit front mats and 3 bench seat long mats I got 2 cheap fronts and 2 small passenger car square ones.  Not at all happy!,0
does not fit  could use a 5$ tarp as well,0

Not very happy at all with thus vehicle.  Traded it in for a Ford within 10 months of buying it new.,0

Worse car ever had ,0
"Looks nice but the fact is THE WORST CAR EVER
Iv 2015 during the first 50k i had have many issues
1-  Engine lifter replaced
2-  radiator cracked
3-  Front shocks replaced twice
4- Cam shaft Changed
5- Steering wheel column repaced
It is all major component the dealer Fix it for me but It was a hassle and I was very stressful to deal with this kind of issues",0
"This cat has been a mechanical nightmare from day one.
I have replaced essentially all parts of the motor aside from the block and pistons.
Inevitably, the check engine light turns on every few thousand miles and this leads to a repair which typically runs from 1-2 thousand dollars.
It burns oil continuously.
I would NEVER, EVER purchase another Mini product again.",0
it is a rote box love gm but not this one very disappointed,0
Do not buy this car we have nothing but issues with it transmission being replaced 2 times already and a lot of many things,0
"Useful comfortable vehicle, but this is the second GMC Savana with a 5.7 liter engine we have owned that has required a new engine at relatively low mileage. After engine replacement, the rest of the vehicle proceeds to fall apart. Latest problem is suspension and plastic body trim. A new body trim kit is $3500.",0
Complete melon. Rusted all over after 5 years of driving lots of mechanical problems. Unlike my 2009 S550 that have today.,0
"Very disappointed in my 2008 Lacrosse.  This is the fourth Buick I've owned and I have always thought I would be a lifetime Buick owner, no longer.  I purchased this vehicle when it was one year old and it has had very unusual problems -- right now it has been loosing power and the warning lights show:  engine reduction, traction off.  It is extremely dangerous in the winter time when this happens because the has no pickup to get out of dangerous situations.  I've actually had the car at a Cleveland, Ohio dealership that did not find the problem when they ran testing on the car for other problems.  I've taken the car to the dealership because the heater didn't work -- they change the radiator for $450!!!!  The air conditioner had a whole in it. I'm so disappointed in the expenses I've had for this car compared to my previous Buicks.",0
"The car is sleek and fun to drive. NOW THE REALITY OF MAZDA USA. Mazda replaced the engine at 25,000 miles due to the side seals failing and  the same exact thing happened to the new factory motor with 29,000 miles on it and Mazda will not stand the new engine.  Mazda USA was no help at all. I was planning on purchasing the Mazda 9 when it comes out however since Mazda turned their back on me so I won't even consider looking at it. I am an adult that kept this car in tip top shape with regular maintenance and I am very disappointed with Mazda USA.",0
Have 2 Darts one of them is a Mopar'13 and they have been in the shop more times then any car I have ever owned.  They both have turbo problems but it never puts out a code and the dealership can't find the problem.,0
. We had 4 different cruzes problems with all from water pumps to the check engine light always going in chevy replaced engine in one light would still come on. Power windows cannot take the vegas heat the plastic breaks/crack snaps about 400 to get them replaced happened to both driver and passenger side. Do not get one of these cars. 4 of them all had problems.,0
"Worked for Tesla for 3 years -  overpriced, unreliable and feels cheap.
Things you will need to replace after owning this vehicle -
Door handles, Wipermotors, Drive Units, Battery Packs, Chargers (under the back seat), Body Control modules, MCU (main screen), TIRES!

Also, your camber in the rear can not be adjusted and set properly.... your tires will eat themselves. GOOD LUCK!
Also, if you're over 250 lbs, the front seats are AWFUL and will begin to rock forward and back once the bushings break in.

When you need to replace these parts out of warranty - prices are as follows:
Doorhandles - 1000
Drive units - 15000 (or random Reman costs)
Battery Packs - 30k + (or random reman costs)
Charges - 3000
MCU - 5000 (or random reman costs)

GOOD LUCK!",0
"What a turd. Another GM lemon. 120k miles and it leaks antifreeze internally and burns ridiculous amounts of oil, (multiple quarts between regular changes). The transmission shifts horribly when cold, extremely erratically, slips and slams into gears. The only good thing about this car is that the body panels are plastic so they won't rust and it consistently gets 30+ mpg which it should because it's completely gutless.",0
Did not fit on the car,0
"Last diesel, last Chevy I'll ever buy! At 117k miles injectors went bad. Dealer says out of warranty. $5000.00! Dealer replaced and said never have to worry about injectors again. At 177k miles injectors bad again. Dealer says good news, no inflation, price still $5000.00!  But hey, the paint has held up well.",0
Great body style. I like a manual transmission which I have but it has an internal hydraulic clutch. Never and I mean never buy a truck with a internal hyd clutch.,0
I currently have this vehicle and I literally say a prayer anytime I have to go more than 5 miles. It has been a rather unique and horrible experience. My fiancee a die hard Dodge/GM buyer said NEVER AGAIN. we have replaced the rear end seal 3 times in 4 yes. Had to completely replace the rear end at 1 point. Replaced the starter the battery twice and the most just goes on. The inside itself is cheap including the door trim coming off. The drivers seat with controls for the seat continuously falls off. Take our advice do NOT BUY!!!! h and there are currently 8 yes 8 recalls.,0
"Junk, don't buy! My opinion",0
"Transmission died at only 102,000 miles. Never towed anything.  Cost more to rebuild than car was worth, so had to salvage it.  Very disappointed because vehicle was otherwise solid.",0
"The car is nice looking - but has the worst suspension of any car I have ever had. I contacted Cadillac and they will not respond and when I take it to a dealer they tell me that the suspension is not adjustable.

If you are looking at a 2014 Escalade and want even a reasonable ride DO NOT BUY THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"This was an appalling little car.

In terms of driver comfort, it was fair.  It had seats that didn't fall through the floor, a steering wheel that turned both left and right, and pedals that went to the floor and came back up again while effecting small changes in the car's behavior.  It had air conditioning.

It was not powerful.  It was never described as powerful which is a good thing, because that would be a lie.  Turning on the air conditioning had the same effect as removing a plug wire from one of the cylinders.  Climbing hills necessitated shifting down two gears.

It gobbled up four CV joints in the time I owned it.  I only owned it about five years.

When I finally got rid of the car, I literally gave it away.  I felt kind of bad for what I was doing to its recipient, too.

The Excel's one claim to the name was in how it handled s***.  It was equipped with a privacy tray above the cargo area, and by simply dropping the lifting tethers from that tray it formed an extremely convenient diaper changing table.  Using it for this purpose you were standing behind the car, under the raised hatch and so out of the rain if there was rain, the diaper bag was conveniently located in the trunk right there under the tray and very close to hand, and the baby was at a perfect diaper changing height.  It would be difficult to design a better diaper changing station.  In this respect and NO other, the Excel is a shining example of how to do things right.

Too bad it has almost nothing to do with being a good car.",0
Piece of junk all it knew how to do was break down,0
2nd worst car I have ever owned. Constant problems due to poor engineering and poor maintenance by previous owner. So glad to be rid of it. I gave the thing away to a charity and I still feel bad for doing that to them.,0
Good Luck,0
2001 mitsubishi eclipse spyder I got this car 2 years ago I had spend tooooo much money just trying to keep it running and it still have problems the only thing I have not replace is the transmission and the engine i can not get rip of it because i will feel  really bad about all the money that is gone so now is just a nice thing to look on my back yard basically is a big paper weight,0
"By far the worst car i ever owned. Major issues and problems with the lock mechanisms, the dash board screen, the side camera etc. In the dealership 3 times for exact same problems. Started the lemon process but could not afford to be without my car for days at a time. The only good part was the comfortable interior that gets the star....",0
It didn't fit my truck,0
"From the moment we purchased this large paperweight we have had problems with it. Even the dealer was not able to fix. The back row seats move side to side when turning. You feel as if your going to fly out of the car. The seatbelts do not lock when you slam your brakes, some of the buttons on the driver's side door that controls the windows, mirrors, and locks stopped working and dealer says they cant fix it. It is a cheap excuse for a van. I will never buy anything from VW. It is a Chrysler town and country or dodge caravan. The salesman even said that everything is Chrysler's except the logo. It has the Chrysler name and logo on almost all the parts. If I could give negative stars; I would.",0

"I think the BMW is the best looking car on the road but it doesn't live up to the hype around quality engineering. I owned the car for ten years and drove it very gently with regular maintenance done on a timely basis. While it didn't a have long list of unusual repairs, it had some things that had to be done prematurely (i.e. things that one might expect to be done at a much higher mileage) The last straw was when the transmission started to slip at 85,000 miles. In addition, BMW and anyone who does repairs on them, seem to think that it's okay to rob you. When I had to replace the battery, I discovered you couldn't just buy an after market battery, you had to get a BMW battery who charged me $450 without installation. What??!!
I recently traded it in for an Audi Q7 which has better owner satisfaction numbers. I'll never buy a BMW again.",0
I wish I could give it 0 stars because that's what the car deserves. I hate this vehicle and I hate relying on it because it's extremely unreliable!,0

Everyday when I see it, I want to kick it in it's face. The latest problems, besides the recalls, the driver's side wheel well has smoke coming out of it, there are TWO belts that need replacing and that may include the thing it's attached to, rotors, and brakes, again. I ONLY gave one star, b/c it goes fast quickly, it has a sunroof, and there are a s*** ton of cupholders.
The starting price on here is $25k+, that is a joke! Not worth that much. Not even close. I'm paying $8k, and I'll be lucky if I get $500 for it when I get rid of it. Which isn't soon enough.",0

"This might be lengthy but worth the read if you are considering buying a Dodge Caravan.

Okay my mother in law bought a 2005 Dodge Caravan SXT 3.3L V6 brand new and kept it meticulously dealer maintained.  I have come to the conclusion that it is either a lemon or just a terrible cheaply made vehicle in general.

It began at 48k miles when it started to over heat and had to have a new radiator installed.  Thinking maybe that was a fluke, my wife and I bought the van anyway to have a nice dependable family vehicle when we had our first son.  The van now has 120k miles and I have had to replace the following.

1.  Fuel Pump
2.  Window Regulators (both sides)
3.  Lock Actuators (both sides)
4.  Tie Rods (both sides)
5.  Hub Assemblies (both sides)
6.  Ball Joints (both sides)
7.  Sway bar links and bushings (both sides, twice)
8.  Upper and Lower Intake Gaskets
9.  Power Steering Reservoir
10.  Rotors and Brake Pads (multiple times)
11.  Control Arms
12.  Complete Exhaust

Now the headliner is sagging, the rear lift gate struts barely hold it up, the DVD player won't eject my kid's movies, the back hatch is beginning to rust, there is an impossible to find clunk in the frontend over small bumps, the new front tires are still wearing (after a professional alignment), the oil pan is leaking, the power steering is whining, and it has a small lifter tick.

Before anyone suggests that it is poor maintenance or neglect, I work on vehicles all the time and I know what I'm doing.  This Caravan being our current only dependable family vehicle especially gets more attention.  Like I said, meticulously maintained and babied and barely has 120k miles.

I have worked on deisels, jeeps, muscle cars, of road rigs, you name it.  I have NEVER had to work on anything as much as this one owner Dodge Caravan.  Never again will I buy another one.",0

We had quite a problem with the engine. I am no mechanic but the way that the diesel feeds into the engine gaskets were corroding and ruining the engine. We now have to add this additive every time we fill up. Also it took Ford from February to July to assess the problem properly and then fix it.,0

I purchased an extended warranty so I didn't have to pay for tge fist transmission replacement, but it's having the same issues (with no check engine light!!!) and will need to be replaced again. I bought it brand new based on the reputation for being a great value, having an amazing mpg,  higher off the ground,  and having lots of space unlike the Civic & other similar models.

My wife and I had a maxima for years. The only thing we ever put in it was a knock sensor. So we never questioned the reliability of Nissan. Well after owning this truck for 7 years here is the list of repairs to date. Mind you the truck only has 92k on it now. Both front wheel bearings driver side twice. Both oil and transmission pans made very thin and rust through. Transmission cooling lines break lines. Of course the rear axle! Let's not forget the PCM relay that kept stranding us on the road because the truck would just shut off. But both of those were easy because everybody knows of those issues. Yes the rack and pinion started to leak on ours as well as I read in another review. That only envolved pulling the entire front end apart due to it being a 4x4. The last thing was all 3 O2s sensors due to a check engine light. Oh and let's not forget the evaporate solenoid twice. The problems all started on this truck when it was 4 years old and had under 60k on it. We love how this truck rides and its looks and It has a great engine but shame on Nissan for not doing a better job. We are looking for a new car and Sad to say will not be buying another Nissan,0

"From 1993 thru 2007 GM made the North Star Aluminum block engine. GM knew that engine was bad. Around 100,000 miles the bolts would pull out of the block making the engine overheat like it had blown a head gasket. I have had three Cadillacs that have done this same exact thing. Because this event happens after 100,000 miles GM has gotten off scott free. On top of the radiator cover it instructs you to put sealer pettets in the radiator. I went to the dealer and the parts guy told me that they had no peletts and the whole problem was a myth.
The repair at the Dealer is $4,700.00 Few places will work on a North Star engine . I found one in Tampa that can repair this problem for $2,700.00 . There is also a company that makes the replacement stud kit. When it happens you instantly have a 3,700 lb paper weight.",0

Deep scratches, which can't be fixed. Talked to the dealer and inspected close to 20 cars on the lot and the rest of the cars had damage to the body and interior which was worse. Dealer offered me $50 gift card. After some back and forth the kick plate and door panel were replaced. Took several weeks to get parts and to get them installed. Came to pickup the car after parts were replaced and discovered that the paint was chipped on rear fender on passenger side. Dealer agreed to repair the damage. Next car started losing power and stopping while being driven. Electronic Throttle Body was replaced two times. Car spent months at the dealership, and dealer drove the car for close to a thousand miles. Car is still losing power and the dealer is unable to resolve the issue. Last Ford in my family died after 5 years and 86,000 miles over almost 20 years ago. Nothing changed in 20 years. Good design, poor quality. Great reviews in the magazine, but no one is talking about the cost of ownership or overall quality.",0
At all costs avoid this car comma they're built like garbage and will not last more than a few years,0
I leased a 2016 Silverado when I was in need of a new truck this was a huge mistake and I will tell you why! I test drove the truck but did not really put enough thought into my own fault I'll admit I simply drove it and decided it would work I got a great lease price and I was happy. I took the truck home and quickly figured out the mistake I had made this truck has the 5.3 with the 6 speed auto and 3.42 gears it has NO power very weak has to downshift on small hills on the freeway the powerband is like a car engine but its in a truck it also has the Active Fuel management that all GM half tons have its absolute garbage constantly shifting in and out of v4 to v8 mode it simply lacks the power to motivate this truck in v8 mode v4 mode is a joke. If you are an old man who does not care about performance this might be your truck but if performance is on your mind this truck is horrible. The fuel economy is much worse than I thought I would get in the summer I avg. 18mpg in the winter about 12mpg. Towing is misery it shifts up and down constantly and has to keep the revs around 3k at a minimum. This engine has no place in the half ton market GM needs to wake up and realize the 6.2 should be the standard engine. I have about 2 years left in my lease and I cant wait to give this truck back I will not make this mistake again Also just to be clear I did ask for a truck with 6.2 and my dealer has 0 on the lot and also found it hard to get and you have to get a LTZ trim level to get the 6.2. If I had any advice its test drive and F150 ecoboost and you will know the low end torque that you are missing in the Chevy. Also one more thing my apple car play does not work well all the time I'm not certain if its my phone or not but I have tried other peoples phones with the same problem so I think its the Radio other than that the truck has not had any major mechanical issues,0
"Bought this new, probably the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Where to begin.

Problems started almost from day 1. The main wiring harness was crimped under the engine and had to be repaired. It went downhill from there.

I maintain my vehicles to a very high standard. I have had several go 300k miles without major repairs. Not so for this one. It makes my Jaguar look like a Honda.

At 150k miles the transmission has now been rebuilt twice. Every single component turned by the serpentine belt has needed replacing. That includes water pump, alternator, power steering pump, AC compressor, tensioners and idlers.

Every suspension component has had to be replaced at least once. Control arms, bushings, ball joints, shocks,  steering rack, etc.

Heater core leaked, AC lines to rear corroded from inside, hvac fan squeals. Rear door cables broke and needed replacing. All sorts of rattles.

Most recent repair is replacement of bad antilock electronic brake control module.  That and the power drivers side mirror.

It has used a quart of oil every 1,000 miles since new. GM says this is normal.",0
"These trailer light wiring harnesses are all junk.
They burn up after a year and cause all my lights (except headlights) to flash, including my license plate light.",0
This is the worst vehicle ever made by GM.  Check it out on line before purchasing.,0
Worst year they made!!,0
"From the cheapazz needle pilot bearing to the driveshaft, the whole transmission assembly must have been designed by an unemployable social linguistics major. Who decided to abandon the 100 year tried and true bronze bushing for that crappy needle bearing? What idiot decided to move the slave cylinder to the back of the throwout bearing making a $1,000 knuckle-busting repair out of a simple $25 dollar repair? And who decided to bolt the tranny to the bellhousing from the INSIDE for heaven's sake? The clutch has no adjustment and is a bear to bleed. Takes right at the floor. Idiots all!  And that fuel pump inside the tank is foolish. Another inexpensive repair turned into a nightmare. I won't even bother to comment on the famous ""spider"" device under the intake manifold, and the plastic timing case. Jeeeez! My next vehicle will be a nice restored 60s or 70s truck or car. On the plus side, it hasn't rusted out - YET.",0
"The acceleration is appalling, it leaks oil and coolant at an alarming rate, and the Versatrak system is about as reliable as a North Korean missile.  Only GM would have a transfer case that requires a $300 oil change.  Then again, only GM has had a problem with their coolant eating through intake gaskets, such as the one on this car.",0
"I bought this vehicle for my small business a few years ago. It was a horrible vehicle, possibly a lemon. About a week after getting the vehicle the rubber/foam door lining on the passenger side fell off. About a month after that the same thing happened on the driver side. The lights (brake lights, blinkers, front lights) were constantly burning out, possibly due to some wiring issue. They had to be replaced multiple times during the two years I had the vehicle. The radiator started leaking after the first year. After getting it fixed at the Ford dealership where they *allegedly* replaced it with a new one it started leaking AGAIN!

This was the first 'American' vehicle I've purchased. My prior vehicles were a Nissan (280zx), Honda (Del Sol), and Toyota (Yaris sedan). I currently own another Honda (CRV). With over 200,000 miles on each of those vehicles I never had half the problems that I had with the Ford.  Is this why 'American' vehicles have such bad reputations? I'll never buy a Ford again.

There were some minor points that I liked about the Transit Connect. The ergonomics of the steering wheel controls were superior to my Honda CRV. In the Hondas the controls (cruise, radio, etc.) are mounted on the steering wheel. On the Transit the controls 'float' statically just behind the steering wheel. This is a much better design, imo. The Transit's Microsoft Sync was a nice feature, but glitchy. Sometimes it wouldn't work until I restarted the vehicle.

One final point. I realize the Transit Connects generally have a good reputation. Why was my experience so negative? There are a few possible explanations. (1) Possibly I had a lemon and my experience is fairly unique. (2) Possibly these issues I experienced don't matter to the majority of buyers. Why do I say that? Because these are primarily sold as cargo vans for businesses that purchase them as a part of a fleet. As someone who has worked for a business with fleet vehicles, I can tell you that the manager and drivers don't care very much about things like the foam around the door frame falling off. And things like a radiator springing a leak aren't a very big deal for the business either since they have commercial warranties. I also had a commercial warranty, but these things mattered a lot to me since my business was as small as you could get (just me). The average business will only care that the vehicle gets the cargo from point A to B and that if it doesn't then its covered by the warranty.",0
"I am more than disappointed with Nissan particularly their 2013 Altima. I have been a Nissan fan and have owned several Nissans including three Altimas since 2008.  I have to admit that this particular model is by far the most terrible vehicle I have ever owned in my life enough to end my admiration for Nissan. The car has a myriad problems most notably the transmission.  I have a 2013 Nissan Altima 3.5 SV automatic transmission with 63K. I purchased it when it had  a little over 40K.  The problem with what I think is the transmission began a week after I bought the vehicle.  This car jerks horrendously at times and feels like it will die or stall on you at any given time.  Like driving a stick shift with no clue on how to drive one.  I have taken it to the dealership on several occasions for this issue and  unfortunately, given that the symptom does not occur at all times, it has been difficult for the technicians to duplicate the problem.  However, it also doesn't help when they test drive the vehicle for less than a mile or two.  it has been a year now and to this day, it has not been resolved.  The problem is becoming more pronounced so hopefully the problem will persists at the hands of the technician on my soon scheduled appointment.  This car is a piece of lemon.  For those of you who have experienced the same problem, I'm sure you can relate.  If not and you are considering purchasing a used 2013 Nissan Altima, please do your research ahead of time.  You can always google it and see how many complaints this vehicle has had.  You can always go to carcomplaints.com and read all problems associated with this vehicle.  This vehicle has been marked as a clonker so avoid it at all cost or research the heck out of it. The other issues I have are livable but the transmission problem is something I just can't seem to ignore. I would love to get rid of this vehicle but unfortunately, it's not feasible financially at the moment so I have to stick this out.  Hope this review helps some of you out there",0
Blew off door at 80 mph first day. Tape not strong enough!,0

"Absolute piece of junk - spent over $6,000 in repairs since I bought this truck in 2011 to keep on the road - Just when I think I've fixed about everything possible, the idiot light comes back with another issue.

(class action lawsuit has been filed against ford but good luck jumping through the hoops to get any money back ) Both exhaust manifolds rusted out, pretty much have to remove the engine to replace those.  Intake manifold issues, phazer cam issues, ignition lock issues, alternator & starter issues - the list goes on and on....When I purchased this truck had less than 90,000 miles - it now has 130,000  - I keep telling myself that it's still cheaper than a new truck payment, but wonder if I'm insane to keep this thing  - I used to be a strong Ford supporter , but this product has switched me to General Motors for my new work van and my wife's vehicle . .

"I've owned this car less than a year.  The Dashboard melted and was replaced after months of arguing with Toyota. The engine burns oil but in order to have it replaced under the Power train warranty, I need records of ""all oil changes in the cars life."" I bought it used - so there aren't records of that. It uses 1.5 quarts of oil per 1200 miles and has only 117,000 miles on it. The radio design is neat but poorly delivered. The stock cd player is either JBL if you pay for it, or a cheap one that doesn't work at all! I went through five of these radios new and used and still couldn't get one that works properly. Finally I ended up paying three times as much for an aftermarket that was designed specifically for these cars. Mind you you CANNOT upgrade to the JBL unless it was offered at the time of purchase. The wiring harnesses don't even exist to upgrade, which annoys the heck out of me! I would have gladly paid for it. The sizing of the seats is incorrect, you will notice after a while that you are sitting on the left edge of the drivers seat. You could remedy this by moving your seat to the left, but then it would be very close to hitting the door panel. Toyotas notoriously defective paint has plagued this car very badly. The overall build quality is garbage. Also, Toyota factory strut mounts are produced very poorly. Everyone seems to be replacing the ""drivers side strut mount"" on these vehicles. The sun visors are held together by cheap plastic and a tiny metal clip that eventually falls down. One day I was driving on the interstate and received a sun visor in my lap! Talk about a car that just keeps on giving and giving. The transmissions have all had programming tsbs due to bad software in the computers and the gas pedals were recalled for sticking. My car always has a new dealership recall or bulletin when I bring it in. I feel like this particular model design should be a buyback from Toyota, like the trucks. Lastly, The rearview mirror on this car was designed using a cheap shiny metallic plastic. My rearview mirror started discoloring itself and was unusable. I ended up replacing it with a mirror off of a 1999 Camry. The 1999 Camry is MUCH more reliable than this!",0
everything great!!!,0
"Nismo rs edition 20k miles currently in the shop with timing chain noise, possibly replacing motor.  Nissan screwed the pooch on the engineering.

"First chevy I have ever owned, will never own again one again now.

Comments about the comments on the ""review"".
1. I am not looking to be some superior reviewer on Amazon, so I stated my opinion and posted a picture of yes - my car.

If you really want the full story let me tell you why I would never again own a Chevy.

- I went to the dealer after getting in a really bad car wreck in June 2014 looking for a replacement for my baby (2009 Nissan Altima). The only cars the dealer had on the lot were hyundai's and this particular Sonic LTZ. I needed a car, so I decided that since it was ""bluetooth, touch screen radio, with XM radio and Onstar"" I figured - ok I'll go for it.

I had my car for 3 hours when the first of many incidents happened. The shifter broke and I was stuck in Drive at work with the shifter (I don't know what it's actually called) unable to be moved. I then realized I had On*Star and so I pressed the button to only realize that the dealership never set it up. I was on the phone and had to give them a TON of information before they would even help me. Finally after an hour an half they finally said they would call a towing company. By this time the security at my work was giving me a hard time because I was just hanging out in a running car and I guess it was suspicious.

Then I realized that I picked the car up from the dealer on empty - so my car died while I was on the phone with On*Star waiting to hear from the towing company. The towing company said they would be at my car in 5 hours. By this time it was 1am and I (a non smoker) had smoked a pack of cigarettes. A guy from work ended up seeing that I was in need and somehow forced the broken shifter into Park, I praised him and then decided that I would take the guy up on his offer to drive me home so I wouldn't have to bother with this car anymore. I told the guy on the On*star speaker that the keys would be on my front tire and then spoke with Security so that they wouldn't prevent the towing company from taking the car.

The next day I called the dealer once they were open and inquired for the car. Ends up Security didn't tell the next shift of my predicament so they wouldn't let them tow the car, and the dealer had no idea what I was talking about in regards to my car was supposed to be in their lot. They finally got that fixed and provided me the car back (this time on a full tank of gas). About 2 weeks later, my car was running weird with the idle again, so I went back to the dealer. Woops, they forgot to replace a couple of the recalls.

Forward track another six months, my car breaks down on my way back from Columbus Ohio. I couldn't imagine why, this car was bought at 48k miles though so I figured it was bad luck again.

It was some wire that went bad after they replaced the recall, and they were suggested to replace the wire; however as it is not a part of the recall - the dealership did not replace it.

Fast forward after another 4 months and $150 later. My car is again at the dealer. Another part that went back and should have been replaced due to a recall the car had - yet again.

Now I've had it break down 3 times within 2 years.. and have spent out of my pocket (Did you guys know the warranty's on Chevy's only go to 50k miles? Imagine that... I bought it at 48k miles... that was a GREAT warranty) about $400.

But wait, there's more. I went in for an oil change and now my battery was suddenly corroded and another part is bad. Why? Oh it was from this recall from xxxx and again I am explained from the mechanic ""this is common since the recall part was replaced; and this one wasn't replaced"".

I don't know how many recalls this car has actually had; but I am now paying for it out of pocket. This is the first Chevy I have ever owned and I only bought it as I needed a car to get to work.

I now have owned it almost 3 years, and the trade in value is now really close to 5k. That's great ... not actually. The resale value on Chevy's or I guess this model is absurd and I am stopped and asked a ton about this car surprisingly. I always recommend other vehicles for their daughter's and son's. Just something else, anything else that the father or mother would have and be more dependable and won't have to worry about it breaking down.

I am going to run this car to the ground and then submit it to the demolition derby so I can watch someone wreck the thing and run over it.

In my life time this is the ONLY car that I continuously had problems with and I am really tired of.

I can write what I want in my reviews as they are my personal opinions. Not everyone may have these experiences or have the same as me so judge for yourself if you really want to waste the money on Chevy Sonic models; however for anyone I meet in real life, I always try to explain that ANYTHING would be better than this car.",0
"Transmission failed at 115K miles car is not worth fixing.
I own both a 2002 Ford Focus and 2007 Ford Fusion and both cars are not reliable and require frequent repair.
I am sticking with Japanese and Korean cars.",0
"I know everyone always says they could give less stars, so I'll just leave it at that. Absolutely worst vehicle. Bought brand new and was hoping for a small reliable vehicle to get around in. What I got stuck with was the car in the shop on average about every 2 weeks! Had to replace the turbo twice as well as the transmission all before 36,000 miles. Oh, and by the way, the warranty sucks on these vehicles to put it lightly. Another thing that disappoints me is that to repair anything engine related, get ready to spend some $$$.  Everything is expensive, even an oil change you're looking at almost $100..

The dealerships are terrible as well as Chrysler LLC. No help from any of them. Just a lot of pointing fingers back and forth with one another and nothing getting accomplished. Even after involving Chrysler LLC after the car was in the shop for 2 weeks for transmission work, they did nothing except a ""courtesy call"" to the facility to see what was happening and then created a work order for me to follow up on. You read that right, for me to follow up on. No call from them giving me information on my vehicle. I had to do the grunt work of waiting on hold anytime I wanted a status check. Ended up getting the car back with the same issues multiple times.

When it went back in for transmission work the second time for the same issue, it sat for another week, so I contacted Chrysler. The head mechanic at the facility personally drove me my car and when giving it back to me ""fixed"" told me ""I don't want to see you or this car again."" Contacted Chrysler to complain and then promptly sold the car to break even.

Wouldn't wish this type of service on my worst enemy. Always feels like pulling teeth with these people to get anything done. I will never buy another Dodge or anything under the Chrysler name. If you have a choice I WOULD NOT get this vehicle. It's a money pit and your time is money. Do yourself a favor and get a Ford Focus, VW, or something else instead. You'll be much happier.",0
"Poor initial quality.  Seat cushions are terrible and deteriorate within 2 years.  Paint flaked off the bumper from improper paint preparation.  Tons of recalls.  Gas mileage is no where close to what the sticker stated.  To get 18MPG I would be lucky...

To say that I hate the vehicle is an understatement.  It is the last Santa Fe I plan on ever purchasing",0
"No, new parts and repairs need to be done very often, since I own it there are more than 50% of its price spend with parts and repairs done to it in order to keep it working",0
Everything breaks. This car is the worst. NEVER BUY IT,0
"Purchased my 2008 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 4X4  Extended cab pick up new in November 2008. Truck ran fine for first few years with all the service being preformed at a local Chevrolet dealership. Once the warranty was up, that's when the problems began. First major issue was at 55,800 miles an emission control valve went, next at 59,000 the fuel pump & module went. That cost me $1800. At 65800 miles the check engine light came on & the truck was running rough. Brought  truck back to the dealership & $736.00 later they informed me that code P0300 engine misfire was the problem. The dealer wanted another $4500 to repair the problem witch was a defective camshaft & valve lifters. Found out that their's a metal plating issue with GM part's for the 4.8 & 5.3 liter V8 gas engines, common problem GM & the Chevrolet dealerships are well aware of it. Their solution to my problem was to trade the truck for a loss of $5000.00 & buy another new one. GM told me that its out of warranty & basically go away. I had the engine rebuilt at another repair shop. Still own truck but will never purchase another General Motors product.",0
"Never have I experienced the kinds of problems this truck has had.

Way to go, Ford.",0
Just transportation nothing more.,0
Worst truck ever.

"Chrysler simply doesn't care about quality or customer satisfaction.  I wanted so much to like my RAM Outdoorsman, even purchased a lifetime extended warranty with the intent on keeping it awhile, but what a disappointment and waste of money.  Wheel Flares coming off at 3K, warped rotors at 24K and the dealer wants $1,200 to replace because they consider it a wear item, my $1800 NAV system was at least 5 years out of date when I purchased the vehicle and they want $145 to update it, media HUB had to be replaced and still doesn't work right, tailgate doesn't fit correct and if I want it fixed I have to elect body shop surgery, various trim issues that the dealer won't even touch because they consider it normal...much like the annoying ""HEMI-Tick and sudden acceleration issues.  I wish I had done my homework prior to purchase...I encourage you to do so.",0
Had problems from the start with it missing Ford service tried fixing it several times warranty ran out and left me with a problem still trying to fix it I'm about ready to get rid of it it's driving me nuts I will never buy a Ford truck again not to mention it is rusting out all over the place and it's only a 2006,0

"Bought a used Beetle convertible.  The engine ran great, but the rest of the car was complete junk. All the interior was plastic which decayed and broke at the lightest touch. The glovebox handle broke off in my daughter's hand, as did both door handles and many various pieces and buttons.
The electrical issues were what finally caused me to scrap the car. The wiring harnesses would ALL need to be replaced because the insulation on each wire would crumble if touched or moved.
VW complicated the HID headlights by adding a computer to each side, just for the headlight.  Replaced the harness for $200, but replacing the headlight and computer was going to be $1000.
My son had a Jetta for a short time, which had the problems.",0
They need instructions,0
"Don't buy any vehicle from Fiat-Chrysler, I have a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Willy's Edition and at first I loved everything about this car but as I started to have one issue after another pop up they've made it all but impossible to enjoy. I had an issue where the rear axel seals and differential cover were all leaking, the dealership agreed to repair the issues but wanted to charge me to replace the fluid. When I contacted Chrysler they told me that fluid exchanges are deemed part of regular maintenance therefor are not covered under the warranty, even though this issue happened with approximately 28,000 miles on the car. There also were several issues with items inside the car rusting, including several tow hooks that mount to the floor in the rear of the vehicle, I was also told that these were not a warranty issue from several different dealerships. Most recently the upper and lower ball joints in the front of the vehicle wore and caused a rotational vibration in the front of the vehicle. The dealership agreed to replace these but would not do an alignment on the vehicle and would not replace the tires that were cupped as a result of what was wrong. When I contacted Chrysler regarding this issue they told me that they are only responsible to replace the part that failed, not any other parts that the failing part damaged, such as the tires. It also took me at least 10 phone calls and 5 voice messages over a weeks time in order to find out that my tires would not be covered. I also was told that had I read my owners manual it states that these things are not covered, which is not true, there is absolutely no mention of this in the owner's manual and they do not provide you with this information until something goes wrong.

Don't waste your time with anything that Chrysler makes, I have met many engineers that have worked for Chrysler or the suppliers that they hire and they are simply looking to make the cheapest parts that they possibly can to put onto their vehicles. Unless you have a spare savings account to purchase all of the additional items that you'll need to make your car last or to replace all of the OEM components on it.",0
"brakes just keep breaking.  this thing goes through breaks every other oil change for the front and about every 4th for the rear, otherwise it might have been an ok car.  make sure you buy lifetime pads, you will get your money's worth.",0
"The vehicle is an expensive pile of automotive problems. It must come close to setting a record for the number of recalls issued for a production vehicle. Engine oil leaks, warped brake rotors front early on, battery failure less than two years, shattering window glass, crazy 9 speed transmission, but these problems plague most of the automotive industry. Wishful thinking engineering, but very poorly executed. But heck who am I to criticize. I am not building vehicles and trying to make stock holders happy. An automotive CEO years ago slammed his hand down on the podium and shouted ""We are not in the business of making cars, we are in the business of making MONEY!"". To which the stock holders cheered with delight. Oh well. On the positive side the vehicle does achieve good gasoline mileage relative to it's weight. This in part is due to the crazy 9 speed transmission and low frictional coefficient 3.2L engine. The ride is firm and secure with good handling manners. Hot heated seats, steering wheel, and a very good cabin heater. A/C works well even on a 100F day in a black paint unit.",0

"Biggest mistake I ever made buying this , I'm going back to Nissan , I bought this brand new and have gone thru 3 batteries so far ( the first one the man at the dealership could not believe it was the battery because it look like it came right out of the factory ) 2 radios , they just quit working and will not power up no matter what you hook them up to ( The first one (factory ) could not be coded to turn on again , the second radio was a aftermarket one , not factory ) . I had to replace 4 headlights bulbs so far and 1 taillight bulb",0

"Absolute garbage vehicle.  The transmission went out at 76K miles. 76!!!  Luckily I had purchased certified pre-owned which had powertrain warranty through 100k, but seriously what car has transmission failure at 76k?  After some research this is extremely common with both the 2013 and 2014 models. Also like nothing is accessible on the car.  They've basically designed it where almost any maintenance has to be done by the dealer.  I would avoid this car at all costs.",0

"Wish I could give it negative stars. Chrysler warranty is horrible. Bought brand new in Nov 13. Numerous recalls  (to be expected on a new model ) had to pay $300 for a software update within the 3yr 36k. Not covered by factory warranty? Paid for extended warranty, dealer didn't want to fix anything. Replaced struts just after factory warranty went out,even though we complained about it before hand. $90for every oil change. Nickel and diming me and it's only 3 yrs old. Just traded it for a new F150. Never again.",0
One of the mounting tabs was broken. I used the fans and motor and the old mounting frame.,0

"When this joke of a car ran it was amazing. It handled like a dream, well enough in fact that if the transmission decided to fail again for the billionth time, I could precisely unload this thing into the small gap between the guard rail and the bridge to let this thing drown in a river. I know the TDI with manual gearbox is another story but avoid the VR6 engine and the automatic like the plague. The first transmission went with 38k miles on it. That one (not covered by VW) went after another 5k miles. Maybe my mistake was, after that one, getting refurbished tranny's but when a new one costs over 6 grand, and a used one still goes for over 3k, it doesn't matter on this crapbox. 2 more transmissions after that, all before 75k miles, wasn't even the tip of the iceberg. ALL of the windows fell due to shoddy plastic clips holding up seriously heavy glass (Seriously VW?) and not even a week after having the car in for inspection the timing chain snapped entering my driveway with ZERO warning. No noise, nothing. The VW dealership didn't believe me because they had just inspected the turd. They STILL wanted $7500 to rebuild this POS. I rebuilt it with the help of family for $4100. If you enjoy burning money this is the garbage for you.",0

"Horrible choice! My husband worked at a Mitsubishi dealership so it seemed like a good deal, I was wrong. Have to buy all factory parts, nothing after market, which makes what could be a cheap repair very expensive. My car is 10 years old and still getting recalls on it. It was nice when I got it and it was only a few years old but once it needed repairs I realized it was a poor choice. Initial cost was super high and maintence is outrageous unless you are rich. I always give Mistubishi horrible reviews when they call for their customer service satisfaction questions after I have taken it in for a recall. I have a family of mechanics so I have managed to duct tape and weld it all together, for now, but it is not a good choice for somebody who is not financially very well off",0
"Bought our Liberty new,  6cyl, sport.  Worst car I've ever owned!  A money pit.  T-case went out just before the warranty ran out,  whew!  But then the real fun started.  Transmission failed just out of warranty,  $3700 to fix.  Then ignition switch failed which required the replacement of the steering column due to a broken casting  mount for the switch $700 to fix.  Then the interlock relay in the shift console failed,  couldn't shift out of park,  $700 to fix.  Power mirrors failed, and then the lockup torque converter started to go out,  traded the POS in for a different vehicle. Would have almost paid to get rid of it by then.  My advise,  if you own a Jeep vehicle for anything other than serious off  roading then trade it in as soon as the warranty expires,  you'll be money ahead!",0

"It's a nice and fun car, but it has had issues since day one. The included the badly designed DV valve, coil pack recalls,bad sensors, multiple n80 valves, several pcv valves, bad fuel senders, actuator valve on turbo,etc. I bought the car with 35,000 miles on it and the check engine light was on from the 1st few days and I don't think it has been off for more that 6 months since I bought it in 2008. I was informed over a year ago that it was part of the Takata airbag recall and Audi has yet to come up with a solution other than don't have people sit in your passenger seat. I asked them if they would do a buy back, but they said you can trade it in for a new Audi and we will give you what we think it is worth. Not to mention that the 3 Audi dealerships I had work on my car were incompetent. One replaced my coil packs on warranty and it took them 5 hours to do it, another charged me $250 to run my codes that I handed to them instead of just telling me what the error codes were after they collected my money they said I was right. The third was another shop regarding the error codes for smog and they were to check out what parts needed to be replaced. The gave me some ungodly number to replace 2 small parts and when I drove down the street my car died because they did not reconnect any of the evap hoses, plugged in the dv valve, n80 valve, and cut a hose off. I had to reconnect everything and fix the hose with parts I had in my trunk on the side of the road. I called the Audi dealership and they said well we're glad you got it fixed. I contacted Audi North America on these 3 issues and they basically said too bad. So if you want a car that will break down constantly, have multiple revisions to parts because they were badly designed, recalls that nothing are done for, and horrible customer service buy an Audi.",0

"By far the worst vehicle I've ever owned.  Shoddy manufacturing all around, cheap materials and poor craftsmanship.  Somewhere just north of 100,000 miles, it basically self-destructed.  The timing belt snapped 23,000 miles before it was due to be changed, cracking the water pump and doing other damage.  It burned through intake gaskets (a known issue with Turbo models) causing misfires and other problems.  The computer started having issues that threw all kinds of random codes and took months to finally diagnose and fix.  The convertible motor lost it's hydraulics.  The front end is so low and so poorly made/attached that the brushguard would come off the frame and start catching every tiny road bump, requiring the entire front cap to be replaced.

It was actually so bad, I believe it's turned me off to Chrysler products forever.",0

It cost me hundreds of dollars to make internet keys because I had to go to Ford to have them programmed, one failed within an hour and Ford refused to reprogram it unless I paid AGAIN.  Noisy brakes, rattle inside right side of van, van has a mind of it's own as to when to preform many tasks like turning on lights, alarm.  I must enter the van through the drivers door and push the unlock button to unlock all doors to open any other one (all that unnecessary wear and tear on electric locks that will fail from overuse and cost a fortune to fix.  Every time I touch the turn signals the wipers come on or get turned off in a rain storm.  The wheels have hubcaps glued to the rims at the factory and I must replace an entire rim because of a damages hub cap.  A lower steering wheel connecting rod is going bad and is a Ford only part for $560.  The rear hatch handle that opens the hatch pulls right out of the door.  Electric mirrors adjust laterally ok but not up/dn..

"Have an 02 se 5spd with the 2.5l. When the car was purchased with around 70k on the clock the engine was already shot. Burned oil like crazy and smoked like a chimney. We swapped the motor with an engine imported with less than 40k on the clock. Inspecting the old motor there were no signs of poor maintenance. After researching online apparently it is a very common problem and a petition but nissan refused a recall. Apparently its a design flaw in the intake manifold which causes screws to drop down into the cylinders.

Since then the shifter itself had to be repaired as it is made of cheap pit metal. The catalytic converter failed and although that could be contributed to the oil loss even with a brand new cat and new o2 sensors the check engine light refuses to stay off. Also a common problem.

I also found the engine itself to be seriously lacking in power for the vehicles size and the engines displacement. I thought it was an issue with the motor itself until I went around a test drive a few other altimas with the same engine.",0

"In 1948, Preston Tucker introduced a revolutionary car, with rear-wheel drive, an air-cooled, aluminum block, horizontally opposed engine, and a streamlined body that would revolutionize the auto industry.  Volkswagen beat him to the punch, however, with the Beetle.

Many people like to make a saint or hero out of Preston Tucker and his quirky car.  It turns out that the car was really not that innovative or special.  In fact, one wonders if the idea of the car came to him after he saw Volkswagens after World War two or perhaps before.  Or maybe got the idea from the Czech Tatra 87 - another rear-engined aerodynamically designed car.

One thing is clear, though, the Tucker car was neither original or unique.  It used a flat ""pancake"" motor, in this case, a helicopter engine made by the Franklin Corporation of Syracuse, New York, which he bought as part of his scheme.  Franklin, like most aircraft engine manufacturers, was struggling after war as demand for aircraft engines plummeted.  It didn't help that Franklin's reputation was not the greatest, compared to Continental and Lycoming.

Some would argue that Tucker drove the Franklin company into the ground with his scheme - cancelling all existing aircraft contracts so the company could ""concentrate"" on building engines for his car.

But a flat-engine, aluminum block, air-cooled car? (Note: later converted to water-cooled, without much success).  Not really a ""new idea"" but one that Ferdinand Porsche and Adolf Hitler had in the 1930's.  And the parallels don't end there.  Many people like to tout the Tucker's ""advances and innovations"" which were really not innovations at all.  Fully independent suspension?  Again, the VW had this, and many German and European cars featured independent suspension well before the war.

The ""safety"" features of the car were laughable by today's standards.  Tucker put a large footwell in front of the passenger seat, with the idea that when an accident was imminent, the passenger could ""duck"" into this ""safety zone"" during the wreck.  The reality of course is, that accidents take place in milliseconds, and no one in a car has time to duck, brace, or otherwise react to an impact.  This is why we have airbags today.

Even the center ""swivel"" headlamp wasn't a Tucker innovation.  Again, the Czech Tatra had this feature and it was even available on US cars in the 1920's.  For some reason, people want to believe in Tucker and thus attribute these ""innovations"" to him.  But you can't ""innovate"" something invented by someone else, decades earlier.

So the Tucker wasn't a revolutionary design at all, really.  Maybe for the US his European ideas seemed ""far out"" but they not inventions of his.

Where Tucker failed, Volkswagen succeeded.  And by the 1960's, VW had established itself as a player in the United States, and today is one of the largest manufacturers (sometimes the largest) in the world.  Oh, right, the ""big-3"" automakers were in a conspiracy to suppress the Tucker.  Funny how they let the VW slip right through their net!

And VW didn't have it very easy.  After the war, the ruined remains of the VW factory were offered to Ford Motor Company, who turned it down.  They literally had to start over from zero, to build up into the powerhouse they are today.  Tucker, on the other hand, had an entire factory nearly given to him for the asking.  No bombed out facilities to start from scratch.  And yet Tucker could not make a go of it, without all of these disadvantages.

In the car-starved market of the postwar era, one wonders why.  Why not raise funds using conventional means - a stock offering, for example.  But instead, he relied to dealer franchises, and deposits on cars yet to be made - selling ""future owners"" radios for cars they would never own.

The story sounds familiar.  Whether a wild-eyed dreamer or a con man, the end result was the same - you can't develop a radically new concept car on a shoestring budget.  It just can't be done.  And even if the SEC investigation hadn't sealed the deal, odds are that by the mid 1950's or the 1960's at the latest, Tucker would have gone the way of Hudson, Studebaker, Kaiser, Frasier, Willys, Packard, Crosley, and a number of other small-time marques that eventually faded into history (including American Motors, LaSalle, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Mercury, among others).

So why do so many people want to believe the myth of Preston Tucker?  Why did Francis Ford Coppola make a movie about him?  And the answer lies in the question:  Belief.  Belief can be an evil thing, blinding people to actual facts, hard data, and numerical analysis.  If the Tucker car was such a great innovation, people would keep making them.  Recall that after the Studebaker plant closed and the company got out of the car business, the Avanti stayed in production for decades.  A number of people stepped up to buy the rights to make the car and made and sold them, which is more than can be said for the Tucker or the Bricklin, or any one of a number of ""dream cars"" that turned into nightmares.

Of course the punchline is that the VW Beetle was a horrific car - if you lived in that era you remember this.  It was tinny and cheap and was a deathtrap to anyone who drove or rode in one.  VW stopped making them because of this.  I have friends who have been injured or burned severely in VW accidents.  It was a very successful car because of its low price for the time.  But in today's litigious climate?  You could not sell a one.

So when you hear about ""visionary dreamers"" trying to sell commodities like cars, you have to wonder what the heck is going on.  After all, it takes millions, if not billions, to develop a new car, and this takes the resources of not one, but often two or three major corporations working in concert.  Consolidation of the car industry has been the result of this - the huge amount of money needed to R&D a new car.  And many smaller automakers are teaming with their opponents to develop niche cars, much as BMW had done with Toyota in development of the new Z-series car.

Preston Tucker?  Not a man and his dream, but a man and a nightmare.  It is sad to see he went down this path, perhaps deluding himself that he could beat the odds and bring a car into production, with so little money to work with.  And maybe he knew all along it wasn't possible, or at some point realized it wouldn't work out and went for the stock fraud instead.  Who knows?  The end result is the same.

But today?  What excuse do we, as investors or ""depositors"" have to be so naive?",0

"I'd give this vehicle zero stars if it was possible because it's a worthless piece of JUNK. Toyota put faulty frames on these trucks for several years which literally rust through from the inside out. Toyota initiated a voluntary buyback program and a frame replacement program (only to avoid being sued for negligence when the frames started to snap while people were driving, not because they give a crap about their customers or their safety), which ended in 2012. Instead of just taking ALL of these vehicles off the road (which would have been the ethical thing to do), Toyota took the easy and CHEAP way out and only dealt with the vehicles that they were able to ""catch"". My point is, I would advise HIGHLY against purchasing one of these vehicles, as the frame WILL eventually rust out and Toyota will NOT do anything about it! Even if you're lucky enough to find a truck that had the frame replaced already, you're probably gonna run into problems with it in the long run (leaf springs, etc.), so DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE TRUCKS!!!",0

"Piss poor time for this to pop up in my email. I just got back from Georgia from picking up my 2007 Tahoe on a trailer. I live in Florida 7 hours away from where it broke down. On my way to the parts store to pick up a new ignition switch. Hopefully that does it. If the timing was a little different on receiving this request to rate my tahoe,  it would have been a 5 star rating. I love it, it has never left me stranded until two days ago. 150000 miles.",0
"Has had major overheating problems. Mechanic says dodge new about rear seal engine leak. Have had to replace entire cooling system from radiator to water pump.

"Engine seized at 50k miles, 7/70000 warrantee was denied due to no oil change receipts.  Dodge's ""generous"" solution was to install a rebuilt engine at a cost to me of only $6k on a truck I still owed $16k on.  I contacted national engine rebuild company to see what a rebuilt engine would cost and they told me that they had many of the same engine that I had, seized up just like mine, so there was a problem with them.  Company does not stand behind their products.  I am a third generation buyer of dodge/jeep products, never again.  I have since purchased a new Toyota 4 runner and a new Chevy Silverado.  Very happy with these purchases so far.",0

"This is the 3rd SRX that I purchased new since 2004.  The first two were great cars but this one is showing how far Cadillac's quality and customer care are falling.  Since the warranty expired several failures that have occurred that, in my opinion, should only happen when the car is much older or have much more mileage.  The air conditioning has failed (at 65K miles), rear view camera failed (70K miles) and the headlight seal failed (70K miles).  Cadillac's customer service (or lack thereof) shows no interest in taking care of these problems.

I had planned to buy one of the new Cadillac XT5s until it became very apparent that Cadillac does not stand behind their product or care about their longtime, loyal customers.  Will be replacing this vehicle with a new BMW X5.",0

I have an SL with tech package and new for 2016 Nissan did away with LED's on exterior lighting and went back to incandescent. The SL comes with auto dimming rear view mirror with digital compass unless you get the tech package then it is taken away but you still have to pay for it in the SL price. and last but not least the technology package comes with LED DRL and headlights but Nissan can choose to emit those as well and just charge you for them in the tech package price. I contacted Nissan customer relations and was told they would do nothing to remedy this situation even if i was willing to pay the difference. The dealer's solution was to put me in a Maxima SR for another 9 grand more. I will write this up as a lesson learned and wait for the Tesla Type 3 and trade this in and never buy a Nissan product again.,0

if you are looking for just a normal car- yea this is it! Bascially- the one I bought - does not do very good in Snow- or rain- this car is the worse car I have ever owned- I don't recommend it to anyone- just because it may have a 3rd row seating- there is no room for nothing to do in the back- once you put that 3rd seat upright- you can probably fit 5 people comfortable- if I had my choice- Never buy this car- my 1st biggest mistake-,0
"If it was possible to put 0 stars I would. When my partner first got the car we thought we were blessed to have a beautiful brand new car. We thought wrong. We got the car in September 2016. It has not been 2 years and the transmission has been supposedly changed 4 times. Within the first 3 months the problem began. He took it to the dealer Hyundai potamkin nyc, they said it was nothing. The problem continued and we kept insisting. So they decided it was best to change the transmission for the first time on a car that we bought with those 6 months zero miles. After the first tine they changed the transmission it ran smoothly than the car began. The second time they changed the transmission it lasted less than the first. Before they changed the transmission for the 3rd time they sent out a Hyundai engineer in hopes that maybe he can spot something the mechanics were missing. He explained to us the duo clutch transmission and how it works. NEVER PURCHASE A CAR WITH A DUO CLUTCH TRANSMISSION. We accepted that as the reasoning behind the problem. Now though, we have taken Tucson to hyundai the 22nd of May, the car is broken. They keep changing parts and nothing fixes it. Less than 2 years and a brand new car. Hyundai needs to approve each part before it is changed. We have not seen the car in more than 2 months. Our BIGGEST MISTAKE was doing business with Hyundai and buying a Hyundai Tucson.",0
only 2 good thing about this car. 1. it is paid for. 2 It still gets me to work and home. The transmission has felt like it is slipping and clunks when it shifts gears. The car has been like this for a long time. I just hope it keeps going for a few more years and I will trade it in for a Honda. I have taken it to the dealer 3 times and was told there is nothing wrong with the transmission. Even my wife thinks there is a problem. Her CRV shifts very smooth and doesn't clunk when shifting into reverse.,0
"terrible purchase. Too many issues to list, but allow me to try: timing, crankshaft and camshaft position sensors, radiator/transmission issues, overheating, relay/computer problems, U joint issues, and recalls galore all before 100,000 miles. Please stay clear from this car",0

"BMW in general is a great car when they are new but once they get old and parts has to be replaced, it gets expensive.  I find myself replacing a lot of costly parts and the labor is very expensive if you take it to the dealer.  If you can find a trusted repair shop who can fix and repair it, then you may be lucky.  But overall I will not advice this car to anyone.  Buy a Toyota and it would last you forever.",0
"Our Passat has 140K on the odo and we have spent so much money on maintenance that we could have bought a good used car like an Accord or Camry. It just nickels and dimes you to death.

The trans went out at 80K, A/C at 40K, the 2 electric fans at 50K. VW maintenance is at least 1/3 higher than Asian and almost 50% more than Ford.
Another reason not to buy a VW is the dealer network and support from VWoA. When our A/C went out they fought tooth and nail trying to blame us for the premature failure - we finally prevailed w/ a compliant to the BBB.",0

As of this writing, we're probably over $4,000 in total repairs over the past five years.  The Sienna is just under 170,000 miles.  There are three outstanding recalls pending, with parts on back order.  So, at the present moment, I would not recommend a Toyota Sienna to anyone.",0

My experience with Jeep themaelves sadly has been nothing but disgusting. My dealings have been with Brighton Jeep in Melbourne and Belcar in Adelaide Australia. The former are plain rude and frankly crooks. The latter incompetent. My Jeep was out of action under warranty for over 5 weeks purchased from Brighton Jeep Melbourne Australia. They still have not paid back the more than $2000 it cost to make it drivable. Google ""Death wobble Jeep"" for more info. Never use Jeep parts, I found out later this was the cause hence they couldn't fix it. Once I'd put after market ball joints on, what a great car. Same goes for other parts I've have installed. Btw this car is stock standard from the factory. If you can get a Jeep without dealing with Chrysler Jeep, you should be fine. I hope this insight helps you",0

"Where to begin.  I've had this thing for over 2 years and have 53,000 miles on it and I have found it uninspiring and downright disappointing.  The gas gauge doesn't go all the way to full, the Bluetooth likes to randomly turn off, and the glove box hangs on one side so it will rattle.  You can see the carpet gap between the rear seat and the door, because heaven forbid you carpet the whole thing.  Sometimes, for no apparent reason, the indicator alarm will turn off and on just to see if I'm still awake I guess.  The chrome n the steering wheel likes to reflect sunlight directly into your eye, also to make sure you are still awake.  I also managed to wear a hole in the floor mat where my heel sits.  I don't wear heels, tap shoes, golf cleats, or anything else that would lead you to believe this would happen.  The trunk remote would work better if the trunk actually opened when you hit the button. With mostly highway driving, I would hope for good gas mileage, but I get a paltry 25-26 mpg.  Not only that, but the fit and finish on the exterior is sup par at best.  The worst thing about it is the auto start/stop feature.  When it works, which is rare, you take your foot off the gas and it jerks like a teenager learning to drive a stick shift.  Its pitiful, but guess what?  No matter who I take it to and how many times, ""we cannot recreate the problem"" is the excuse I get. The General should have been taken behind the barn for a bullet, not bailed out.  The good news is I learned a lesson, never buy anything from GM again.  My 22 year love affair is over.",0

"I have had problems with this vehicle since I purchased it.  A few months after I had it I had to have it towed backed to the dealer.  They kept it days trying to figure out what was the problem.  The auto lift on the trunk was repaired 4 times and still is inoperative.  The shocks were to be replaced, but it still made that same noise.  GM gave me service for 24 months but refused to replace the vehicle.  I purchased it new, it was built in the Texas plant, someone must have been new who built it or drunk.  The arm rests, the back doors, the dashboard cracked, and the power seats all had to be repaired.  This was when it was still new and under warranty.  GM said that I had to have the same problem repaired 3 times before lemon law woul apply.  Each time trunk was repaired the dealership claimed that it was something different, even though it had the same  problem.  Definitely will not purchase another one.",0

"Let me just say this: it's amazing to me that Chevy even still exist as a brand if this is what they're offering. Who, exactly, is buying this junk? I mean - who, apart from rental companies? I'm wondering if Chevy realize it's 2016 or if they think it's still the mid 1970's?

I had one of these on rental for a 900 mile round trip. The model I drove was a 2016 version with 13,000 miles on it - essentially a new car. With the trim level in the vehicle I was in, it starts just shy of $30,000. Let me tell you, that's $30,000 too much.

Where to start? The engine maybe? Ok let's talk about the engine. It was a rental, so it had the 2.4L engine which Chevy claim has 182hp/172lbft of torque with a kerb weight of 3788lbs. My daily driver - a Range Rover Evoque - has 240hp and 250lbft of torque from an engine that is 400cc smaller and even though the Evoque weighs 200lbs more, it drives like an actual car. The Equinox drives like the Queen Mary. The engine is slow to respond and wooden, and it's connected to the accelerator pedal via twitter. Bolted to the back of the engine is a thoroughly 1970's American-built automatic slushbox. Honestly I thought the days of this sort of transmission were long gone. Over the last 16 years, the automatic boxes in my Subarus, Hondas, VWs and Range Rover have all been excellent. The Equinox appears to have a bowl of loose custard for a transmission. With the cruise control set at 80mph, even the slightest hill caused the box to change down. Get on to a steep hill and it kicked down to fourth. Get on to a canyon road and it kicked down to third. So I spent a good portion of my driving time in this car stuck in third gear, the engine screaming at over 7000rpm and still losing speed going uphill. It's the only car I've driven where a gearbox kickdown results in a lot of noise but no appreciable gain in torque or speed.

It's actually dangerous. When you pull out to overtake, the engine can't muster enough power to accelerate so you end up crawling past the vehicle in front. This isn't too bad on a freeway where everyone is going the same direction but if you were trying to do this on a two-lane road, overtaking a slower vehicle into oncoming traffic, it would be suicidal.

The end result of all this is that this vehicle managed an average of just 19mpg on the freeway. Chevy claim 31mpg on their website, and even accepting that that figure is unachievable, you'd think it might be in the high 20's - something like 25-26mpg. But no - 19mpg.
31mpg is an outright lie and is completely unachievable.

What about the rest of it? The brakes are wooden - and I think that's being kind. They're hard and have no feel to them. The brake assist system is vague meaning you need far more pedal pressure than you'd imagine to get the brakes to engage, and once they do, the brake response is woefully underpowerd for a car of this weight.

The suspension is boaty and vague, making the ride soft and wallowy, adding to the Queen-Mary-like driving experience. The horrible engine, the heavy car, heavy brakes and heavy steering ultimately mean you should stay away from corners at all costs.

The interior is bland and plastic, and not good plastic, but hard, brittle plastic that squeaks and rattles and is offensive to touch. The steering wheel is too big (and connected to a horrendously overpowered power steering system), the rest of the controls are too small and have the added bonus of all being in the wrong place (indicators are where wipers should be and vice versa). The driver's left-side elbow rest (on the door) is solid, unpadded plastic, making it uncomfortable to use on long journeys. The right side (center console) rest is too far back so you can't use it for support at all. The interior is covered in shiny silver plastic and chrome meaning that any amount of sunlight finds something to reflect off. The instrument binnacle is a genius piece of design that does nothing other than reflect the back of the steering wheel if there's any daylight at all. The picture below shows the best-case scenario of what I could see for 900 miles. When the sun came out strong, the reflections were worse than this and the instruments were completely unreadable.

The multimedia system is user-hostile with an interface designed by a blind person. The Bluetooth connectivity is sketchy and tends to forget what device it's connected to on a random basis, forcing you to re-pair devices mid-journey. The backup camera looks like a Super NES game.

I'd like to say the redeeming feature is the way it looks, but it looks like the Chevy designers (and I use the word 'designers' lightly) just threw a lump of clay on the floor and said ""that's perfect - add some wheels and we're done"".

Overall this car seems to have been designed by people who hate cars, for people who hate driving. I can see how it would be an enticing vehicle for someone who works from home so their commute involves never getting into this spiteful piece of engineering. But for anyone else? There's no way any sentient human would willingly buy this.

Chevy's slogan for the Equinox is ""Love the journey"". Counterpoint: I absolutely hated the journey. The journey was the worst part of the weekend thanks to Chevy. This vehicle needs to die in a fire.",0

"This vehicle has been among the three worst investments in my life along with Enron stock and Transocean Stock.  I bought the car new in 2011 and have put 120,000 miles on it fraught with problems.  Here is a basic run down.

Variable valve timing failure - recall - left me stranded - towed to dealership, fixed under warranty minus the tow and rental car

"OK where do I start, I purchased this new Chrysler Lemon back in 2010 from Levittown Chrysler NY (AKA) the dealer stealer since the first day of purchase we have had nothing but problems. If you are really interested in a T&C I can not tell you about any other year but the 2010 however most parts on the older and newer are the same and or similar. And if my ranting and review is not enough evidence for you do an in depth search before you purchase a death trap like we did. places like the NHSTA and  car complaints.com are just 2 of hundreds of places to get very valuable info. Let me tell you so far this vehicle has 3 outstanding recalls, and thousands of TSB's and 5 investigations from certain other agencies. Problems from the vehicle stalling while driving, electrical problems, fluid leaks transmission problems, motor problems, oil consumption problems where you have to add a quart of oil every 3 weeks or you will burn up the motor frying the pistons,rods,etc. So far the only thing keeping this lemon operational is Amazon and Autozone. Autozone has some parts that have lifetime warranties as does Amazon. Yes I know what you are thinking why keep it if you are having these problems, well I can tell you is I have tried to work with the dealer that we purchased it from which by the way don't trust they have been sued by the A/G for deceptive selling practicing and lying to their customers do research you will find the truth it is a matter of public record, I just wish I came across someone like me who gave an honest review on what to look out for. Anyway I have even tried working with Chrysler headquarters nothing but hard problems with no help from anyone when we had a warranty it came with only 3 year 36,00 mile which ever comes first for bumper to bumper protection and the power-train I think was 5 year or 60,000 miles which ever occurs first, OK so they never found any problem under warranty in fact their exact words were on record we can not duplicate problem, well we had like 7 failed attempts then we got fed up looking for better ways to get help so we  researched Lemon Law attorneys they were also no help they were all like Chrysler is the worst to deal with and they were not able to help. In our current situation which I by law can not divulge any information (hint) we are not allowed to have any credit for about 5 years so keep this in mind we can not afford nor can we legally purchase a replacement vehicle, we did get lucky I am a ASE mechanic but no license so I know my way around cars I am not a fool but these dealers and Chrysler corporation think we are all fools and crash test dummy I am almost done ranting I swear just wanted to add this last thing at the end they the dealer and Chrysler Corp kept pushing the problems past our warranty saying no problem exists and what do you know after the warranty expired they say yes your vehicle has lots of problems only now they find these problems knowing that you meaning us the people will have to pay out of pocket expenses. Just to let you know you can not even bring your car anymore with out paying a diagnostic fee. OK so I hope I have helped anyone interested in this Chrysler minivan I can not tell you what to do but I can advise you what to be aware of so please beware of this vehicle because in our experience it was terrible never will we ever purchase a Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep ever again. Thank you for reading my review and good luck to you all.

Dealership and Mini were no help. The car only has about 85,000 miles now and is pretty much at the end of it's life. If you really want a Mini, I would suggest leasing and dumping before you reach the end of the manufactures warranty. Definitely do not buy a used one. I would personally never purchase or lease a Mini again.",0
"Overall the concept of the wrangler was cool ( with 4 doors, 4 wheel drive, top that comes off) but the problem with mine and many others of that model is with the front end. DEATH WOBBLE!! I bought mine with 70000 miles on it and had it for about a year, spent over 3000.00 on parts and 2 trips to the shop. Still I was worried it would start the death wobble again. Nearly had several accidents and probably took a few years off my life. I finally had to wholesale it out of my life. It ruined my lifetime love for jeeps. NEVER AGAIN!!",0

Defects: drinks about a quart of oil every week, both driver and passenger visors can't stay up.  Visors replaced under warranty, but replacement visors have the same defect, and Toyota will not replace those.

If you plan on owning the car for a long time, do the math.  It's not worth it.  And then the old hybrid battery's toxic lithium has to be disposed of.",0

Had a heater hose blow only to find I needed a toll to remove the hose from the heater core. One week back order for the tool. I'll buy an old SUV and rebuild it. That would be cheaper than having to being the newer ones to the mechanic for simple service.",0
"I bought this car with 245,000 miles on it because it looked immaculate, and hearing about the work done by the last owner, I thought that all of the major parts were taken care of/replaced as needed. I'm just going to say, this car always wants something. It is a complete money pit. It is not a pleasure to drive, and no matter how much you put in, it will not be a great ride. I bought the car for $1400. The owner said he put a transmission in less than a year before I bought it. I needed to buy a new fuel pump after driving it for about 2,000 miles, and it required dropping the tank, which I couldn't do, so I had a shop do for close to $700. I flushed the power steering fluid, and then the ps pump went out. I changed the alternator. I gave it coolant. I put in about twice what I paid for it, thinking I would keep the car forever and give it what it needs, but you just can't do that with the GL Taurus. About 6 months after I bought it, the transmission failed. It turns out, the AX4N and AX4S transmissions are known for only lasting 30-60 thousand miles. The car still needed a transaxle and seal and a water pump before I junked it. I tried to give it everything it needed when it needed it, but I just couldn't afford to keep it well. It was worse than a BMW, and I will rest well no other poor soul will have the displeasure of driving this thing. There is a reason why it has a $500 MSRP. It will take everything. Dump this worthless P.O.S. It's just not worth it. I got $75 from the junk yard for it, and I feel like I pulled one over on them. The turn-radius it also atrocious.

Sincerely,
Eric Fischer",0
"One of the brackets wasn't long enough. The mounts for the screws didn't match up, way too short.",0
"In a fit of patriotism, I bought a 2008 Malibu that was an early production GM test mule in July 2008 with around 11k miles.  Unfortunately for me, it was bought only a few months before the US/Canadian taxpayer bailouts of 2008, and although the 100,000 mile warranty was...sort of...technically honored, utilizing said warranty was as easy as pulling teeth without novocaine since it was considered ""Old GM"".  It was among the worst cars fit-and-finish wise i've ever owned.  I sold it about 5 years ago, but will recount my experiences with the car so hopefully you won't make the same mistake in buying one.  Full disclosure: I DID put over 100k miles on it in those 4 years, but most similar Honda, Toyota and others would not have had 1/4 the parts failures I had on this car.  I am also a Honda technician with 15 years of experience.  May want to pop some popcorn for this one...

2 months after buying it, all four of the door latches would not engage intermittently, either holding the doors open, or not allowing them to open.  Pretty disconcerting considering I had a newborn baby that rode in the car regularly.  ALL FOUR door lock actuator/latch assemblies were defective.  These were replaced without hassle under warranty.

It had the 4-speed transaxle originally found in the contemporary Saturn L-Series.  The Torque Converter Control solenoid, located inside the transmission housing, was faulty from the day I bought it.  As a result, the torque converter would lock in and out on its own at highway speeds, jumping about 500 rpm in fourth gear at cruising speeds (55mph or above) thus lowering fuel economy.  I owned it for about 4 years, and although most of the miles I put on were open highway, I never averaged over 28mpg per tank.  In cold temperatures, say anything below freezing (living in the Upper Midwest), it didn't break 20, and was sometimes as bad as 18mpg.  I brought it in 4 times to three different GM dealers (INCLUDING THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM) and it was never fixed.  Each time, although there is a TSB for solenoid replacement (which involves removal and disassembly of the entire transmission), each dealer would simply reprogram the Adaptive Shifting software and return the car, usually after keeping it one week for diagnosis.  The condition would return after about 100 miles.  Considered starting litigation against GM under lemon law, but didn't (I should have).

Front strut mounts were COMPLETELY shot after 60k miles, so bad that when turning the bearings would bind causing severe springing noises from the front suspension.  Of course this was chalked up to ""normal wear and tear"", thus no warranty coverage.  That was $600, for the least expensive replacements struts and mounts I could find (and not even with springs!?), and that just for parts - I replaced them myself.

There was a warranty extension to 100k miles for the electric power steering failing.  And by failing, I mean ALL POWER STEERING ASSIST failing.  When this happens, you still have the fail-safe since there is a mechanical linkage, but when it happens it's like steering a Abrams tank.  So of course, it eventually gave out.  At 101k miles.  Once again, GM wouldn't touch it under said extension, despite contacting the district parts/service rep for goodwill assistance.  They didn't even entertain covering it.  The TSB calls for steering angle sensor replacement, housed inside the electric power steering column/motor assembly.  Reading up on it online on some forums of both Malibu owners and GM master techs, I found that replacing the ENTIRE column is the correct fix since if you replaced only the steering angle sensor, it would likely fail soon after.  Replacement column through GM, with ""good-guy discount"", $500 (back in 2011).  Again, I replaced it myself.  It took 6 hours to replace.

Tires, brake pads and rotors needed replacement every 20k miles, like clockwork.  This despite an alignment being performed every 6 months (regarding the tires).  It didn't matter what brand of replacements used, at first I went OEM GM pads and rotors, but after those too failed at around the same mileage, I went highest quality aftermarket.  No difference.  Brake caliper pistons and pins did move freely and shims were replaced and/or cleaned with wire brush at every replacement.  I suspect it was due to the ADD-inspired ABS system that would kick in at will, sometimes for no reason while braking.  No ABS light or DTC for ABS control module faults = you guessed it - no warranty coverage.  Tires were OEM Hankooks, which are usually good for at least 50k miles on other makes.  Eventually went with even ""better"" Michelins, AFTER strut replacement, with same result.

On the bright side, it was relatively quiet inside, the engine was ran decent, and the car looked somewhat upscale.  However, in retrospect, I should have bought the same year Mercedes C-Class.  The car would have had similar issues, the replacement parts would have cost about the same, and I would have increased social standing by at least one caste instead of looking like I live in a trailer park (no offense to mobile home dwellers).

I traded this car in on a base model 2012 Hyundai Accent.  It was a much better built car - and I put about 50k miles on that.
If you drive more than 5k miles/year, I wouldn't recommend this car under any circumstances.  If you drive more than that and must have a mid-sized sedan, buy a Honda Accord or a Toyota Camry.

After this car - unless its a truck, Camaro or a Corvette, i'll never own a new-age Chevy again.  EVER.",0

"Itsa nice vehicle and performs well BUT...
Chrysler really blew it with their brakes engineering! And they refuse to take responsibility for that and correct the issues and solve the problem. Buyer beware of any Chrysler or Dodge product with this generation (version) of brakes!!
Don't take my word for it. Just google brake issues for this class of vehicle and you'll find 10s of 1,000s of complaints! It is challenging to sift through them all to find possible remedies. Mostly what you'll find is referrals to lemon law attorneys. Go for it if that sort of activity suits ya!
Mine has 57k miles and has already burned up and destroyed 2 sets of front rotors and pads. And this time the calipers were beyond salvage as well. Yet most of the issues you'll find on the net actually admit to difficulties with the rear brakes. Chrysler even issued a ""redesigned"" caliper bracket for the rear brakes, in so many words 'fessing up' to the issues. However, that doesn't solve the issues. Only gives the apparency that they care about it.
I believe I may have put a ""band-aid"" on the problem but, at great time & and expense. Time will tell if I found a remedy but, I can assure you that my remedy will require constant vigilance and excessive maintenance! If it is worth it to you, you can do the same or pay for new parts every 20k miles or simply leave your friends, family, & fellow roasters at risk of peril.

"Upgraded from a 2013 XLT crew cab - one of the worst mistakes I've ever made.  The seats are not comfortable, the cooling seats are joke (even after repair), less room in the backseat area, the ride is terrible (dealer states working as designed) - bounces around on the road and feels like something is not balance (i.e. not smooth like my 2013), and biggest disappointment: gas mileage no improvement with the 15's aluminum body or on the big v6 eco-boost vs the 2013's 5.0  v8.

The plastic pieces on the interior are brittle and literally disintegrate within the first months of ownership. By the time I got rid of it 8 months later I had replaced:

*Every single power lock actuator on every door including the trunk.
*An injector for a cylinder #4 misfire
*Every door and sunroof gasket seals
*Infotainment system x4
*The heads up display

"Warning!!!! Stay away from this Fiat junk!!!!

Bought this car new in 2014 excited about the efficiency, comfort, off-road capability and its ability to tow. I can now say all of those goals were ruined when it came to quality and reliability. I dealt with a slew of problems and recalls since purchasing this vehicle, ultimately spending approximately 4 months in the shop out of the 24 months I owned it.

Countless TSBs for the insufferably confused 9 speed transmission, complete failure of the 4wd PTU (Power Transfer Unit).  Countless recalls for the Airbag, Windshield Wipers, Body Control Module the list goes on. And having random parts replaced from the gear shifter, to axle seals to CV axles.

Dont expect Chrysler to stand behind their powertrain warranty after 36k miles either. At one point I took in my vehicle for more unexplained noise and harsh transmission shifting, I was informed the noise couldn't be diagnosed but that a software update was available for three different vehicle control modules. This software would cost near 200+$ and was not covered under the powertrain warranty. (This was in addition to previous transmission updates/TSB's that Ive had performed, is Chrysler just guessing?) First, let me say 200+$ is ridiculous to pay for someone to plug in a computer to my OBDII port and perform a 5 min update to these modules that shouldve been done to begin with. I explained that it says in the warranty that it covers the control modules, but the Chrysler disagreed stating that it would only cover the hardware and that software upgrades had to be charged after the 3 year 36k mile warranty period. My question here is if the software update didn't fix something that was wrong in the transmission why release it to start with?

Although Im not an electric car fan, I hope the Tesla's and the Apple's of the world can change this standpoint of the auto industry that ""once its sold its not their problem anymore"" and unsporting/obsoleting vehicles as soon as 1 Year after being sold, as my Cherokee was with its 8.4"" Uconnect system which is sadly called the best in the industry. This is plainly unacceptable.

Though I have impressed plenty of people with this car's capabilities off-road and comfort on, but where the platform has fell short remains the same, support and reliability. Extremely disappointed in this vehicle. FYI, traded to a wrangler and have not looked back reliability wise.",0

"The check engine light is perpetually on. It comes on if it doesn't like the way the gas cap is seated, if the throttle body wants cleaning, if a speaker blows out. Sometimes I wonder if it thinks turning on that light is just festive. It had a MAPS sensor error requiring a software update from the dealer, so the car went into limp mode and would barely move. The cruise control is on the same arm as the turn signal, and if you bump this arm slightly when attempting to use cruise, it activates the turn signal just long enough to make the person behind you wonder where exactly you think you're going.",0
"Transmission slippage started just months after warranty period.  I find that many owners of this vehicle have suffered the same humiliation.

Your radio catches every drip of coffee that goes down the cup!  There is also this thing between the two front seats, where you can drop your clutter .... you will have to navigate around that thing every time you put engage or disengage the hand brake.

I had to bring my new Spark in 4 times as the climate controls were not working. I have had the car for 6 months and am getting 22 mpg. I brought the car in for maintenance and was told that it was fine - mileage varies. This was sold to me as a econo car that would get good mileage.  My 10 year old Nissan Altima got about this type of mileage and a friend with the same commute gets about 35mpg in her 6 year old Fiat. The Spark does not perform as advertised. I will not buy another GM car.,0
"If you're interested in finding out how bad Jeep/FCA quality truly is and you don't believe J.D. Power or any other rating system, this is the perfect SUV to find out with. You'll spend plenty of time in the shop, waiting for your latest recall about how it may randomly catch fire, or generally hating when you have to drive it because your spouse has the whatever other car in your family.

"I'm the sole driver of this car and I do not have children and very rarely passengers and yet all four of my door handles snap off. I'd understand if the drivers side broke off but the other 3 doors have been used rarely. I also have a drivers side mirror that the cap has fallen off. Both the door handles and the missing mirror cover seem to be a problem as I see many Altima's in the same date range with these parts missing. My car is pewter and the paint is gone on my roof and hood. I have two co-workers that drive the same model with the same color paint and their cars have the same paint wear and when driving around town I see this on other cars as well. Lastly, the head light covers on Nissan Altima's fog over and look horrible. All of these issues are manufacturing defects that Nissan doesn't see fit to repair. So if you want a car that you can drive for 10 years Nissan makes a reasonable product but if you want to drive a car for ten years that doesn't look like it belongs in the junk yard, buy a Honda or a MItsubishi or a Toyota as I've never seen anything this bad on frankly any other older model cars from other manufacturers. Nissan needs to step up to the plate and take care of their manufacturing defects if they want any sort of buyer loyalty. I will NEVER buy a Nissan product again.",0

"Squeaky brakes. Whiney Engine. uConnect is the worst radio I have ever used, and that includes rental cars. The exterior design on the front looks great, then you get past the a pillar and it falls apart at looks like a 1999 RAV4. The interior is gaudy, and over designed. I know that Jeep is proud of the hidden sarge badge, but it is way over board in this CUV.  The highway ride is super loud, and the transmission cannot decide what gear to select. The fit and finish is nice, as are the leather seats.

"First 6 months of ownership went well; but then I was involved in a rear-end accident, and the insurance company refused to repair all of the damage caused to the vehicle - only the easily seen cosmetic damage. I was stuck with either paying to replace the engine out of pocket or suing an insurance company out of my pocket. Soon I had nothing but trouble with this vehicle. The rear impact caused the drive shaft to damage the engine main oil seals and I had constant oil leaking from the motor; various fuel and emissions sensors failed and the 4WD module failed too. Chevy dealer mechanics ripped me off every opportunity they got, and when I tried to trade it in on a new truck, the salesman told me they wouldn't give me more than $1,200.00 for it.  He acted startled when I asked why he thought I would ever buy another Chevrolet when they had no pride or sense of value for their own products. I finally managed to sell it to a guy who owns a garage and could afford to pour money into the black hole my truck had become.",0
"I bought a 2013 new. The truck was well taken care of. Rust specks started on the whole rear of the truck in the first year. Ford told me that it was railway dust and polished them (mostly) away.

"The 2004 Chevrolet Classic (or more accurately, the '97-'03 Malibu and '04-'05 Classic), is not a very good car.  It has a work horse engine that has pretty good longevity - attested to by the number of these cars still on the road - but it's a cantankerous, problem-laden beast.  One of the main complaints with the car - and one I've personally run into multiple times on my own car - is the A/C control panel.  They constantly go bad - causing it to randomly switch between inside and outside air, and the A/C itself to run intermittently.  There's a fix for this on the internet (easily found on YouTube) for cleaning the contacts inside the panel.  But unless you have some maintenance or electrical experience, you're probably going to be stuck just buying a new panel.  Even reconditioned, you're looking at over $100 - and it will probably fail again within a year.  The fuel system is spotty also, especially the EVAP/fuel vapor recovery components.  My ""Classic"" has a perpetual fault light right now due to the EVAP canister - something that would cost at least a $1000 to fix and is not a DIY project (requires dropping of the muffler/exhaust pipe and gas tank).  Somebody else commented that they get 26-31 mpg with it after 200,000 miles.  Sorry, but No.  There's simply no way.  It's original EPA rating when new was 21mpg City/31mpg Highway.  Mine has about 175,000 miles and gets about 20mpg City/25 mpg Highway.  Even perfectly maintained, there's no way that at 200,000 miles they're getting better mileage (or even the same) as its original EPA rating.  Frankly, instead of ""Classic,"" I'd call this car a ""Classic POS.""  If you have other options as far as buying a car, take them.  This car will nickel-and-dime you, and annoy you in so many ways.",0

"Well, where do I begin.  I have owned Jeeps all of life This Jeep it the third one that I have owned.  So I will compare to to all of the one's that I have owned.  I look at a Jeep as a truck not a SUV. The first Jeep I owned was a WWII Ford -built Jeep.  It was great and rough transportation. It had no luxuries but it was easy to fix and always worked.  The second was a 1979 CJ-7 Golden Eagle Hard Top V-8 with a T-18A transmission.  This is a great Jeep!!  It was not as big as the 2007 - 2017 body style. It had power and luxuries, AC, Power Steering, Power Brakes, etc. The CJ7 could go anywhere and get out of trouble. That Jeep only had two problems. Body rust and bad tires.  The bodies on the CJ7 were not e-coated and would rot out.  The Goodyear tires that came with the CJ7 had a tendency to fishtail in snow.  I replaced them with the BF Goodrich All Terrain AT which is a better street and off road tire.  I loved that Jeep, it was a truck.  The next Jeep I purchased was the 2006 Jeep Wrangler.  The 2007 year Jeeps were out and I did not like the 4 door Wrangler Limited and it looked more like Hummer than a Jeep.  I did not find one of the last 2006 Jeep Wrangler Limited with a dark Blue Body and Black Hard Top.  While the lay out of the 2006 Wrangler Unlimited is very simular to the CJ7 that is where their similairites end.  The 2006 still came with the same old Goodyear tires which I which out.  I did like the swingout rear door and the wiper on the rear window.  The 2006 body was also e-coated which prevented body rot. Only recently have I notice some rust spot not bad for ten years!!  Mechanically, the engine, transmission and drive train are bad.  I had to replace the front disk brake rotors after 10,000 miles.  This is with just plain street driving.  I replaced the front disk rotor with heavy duty slotted rotor and ceramic disk pads.  I have 117,000 miles on the 2006 Jeep and the front rotors and ceramic brake pads are still good!!  The next major problem is the oil pump and distributor rotor, a very poor design. When they go it sounds like a small animal being caught up under the hood of the Jeep.  I had to replace this item 4 times since I owned the 2006 Jeep. The last time the Jeep dealer had no idea how to fix it.  I had to tell how to fix it and re-program the computer quite expensive and they had the Jeep for 4 days!!  If I had the parts I could have done the repair in about 2 hours if that not 4 days!!  The Transmission is designed for a lightweight SUV not a truck.  There is a great many plastic and aluminum parts in the transmission it had to be repaired twice. My 1979 CJ7 has 257,000 miles on it and I had to only replace the clutch plate and throwout bear once!!  There is a company that rebuilds the 2006 Jeep auto transmission with steel parts and guarantees the transmission for 250,000 miles!! Price $2,000.00.  To repalce the muffler and pipes which are too small for the 2006 Jeep, I had to take off the skid plate and jump up the transfer case and transmission. Why Jeep bolted the transmission to the skid plate is beyond me. On the CJ7 the muffler is bolted to the frame as well as the transmission and transfer case.  I would not buy a new Jeep, way too expensive and not great.  I would completely rebuild CJ7 and the 2006 Jeep Wrangler for half the money they want for a new Jeep with more unknown and unwanted problems.  I would probably put a 4BT Cummins Diesel with the T-18A transmission and ungrade the luxury items in the Jeep.

This has been a good car for commuting to work and great gas mileage,0
I hated that Van. It was uncomfortable and a gas hog!,0
Its bull crap all of them should have fog lights on them It doesnt matter if its a low-end or high-end of that car,0
"Too many repairs needed. First it was my TIPM, the whole thing was just shot and it needed a total replacement. Then all my tire pressure sensors needed to be replaced. They all went bad one after the other. My power steering pump and alternator are going bad and will need to be replaced soon. The power sliding door motors don't seem to be working well either so more than likely those will need replacement soon too. My uConnect is having issues too. The navigation system is just displaying a black screen and the dealer wants $100/hr to troubleshoot my uConnect system, so google maps on my phone it is. Brakes are constantly needing to be repaired/replaced, because for some reason the rotors keep wearing unevenly causing damage due to the uneven surface and resulting vibrations. Transmission problems are abundant to say the least. Sticky shifting, lack of power and the list just keeps going. I could just keep going and going like the Energizer Bunny but I think you guys get it by now. Just be warned and stay away from this nightmare if at all possible. This vehicle is by far the worst experience I have ever had with an auto.",0
"My first and last VOLVO. It has been a horrible car.  Everything breaks in it, and parts are extremely expensive, in many cases higher than Mercedes and BMW. Even the simplest of elements, like the PCV valve is replaced with an ""oil breathing box"", that not only is very expensive, but it requires a lot of labor to replace and it broke within 40,000 miles.  Will never own another Volvo. By the way, the car, even though it is a 2002, has only over 60,000 miles.",0
"What a terrible car.  This van was a lot like an under cooked piece of chicken, sure it looks good on the outside, but once you get into it, you realize the mistake.  The usual suspects propped up on this, between 45000-48000 miles, the AC Condensor and Radiator went. After fixing, the water pump went in the mid 60K range, later around 70K miles the transmission, Master Cylinder, and engine seals needed to be replaced.  The dealership did all the maintenance at the regular intervals and would tell us that it was just the car, there was nothing we could do.",0

"Car went up in flames when pnmping the car ahead at five(5) miles an hour.  Found out there was a recall on Jetta models because of fuel line fire hazards but our model Jetta was not on the recall.

Had to leave it without our belongings!",0
"I bought my Cooper Clubman S used and it has turned out to be a huge mistake. At the time I bought the car it had 55k miles and ran great. Just like everyone else I liked the go-kart handling and the fuel economy. At 79k miles I had the death rattle and had to do a timing chain assembly replacement. I was able to negotiate with the dealership to get this done for $1200 instead of more money. There was a class action settlement with Mini over selling the car with a known timing chain tensioner issue that created the death rattle but I was unable to take part due to performing my own oil changes and not paying a stealership to change my oil. Therefore never recouping my money for the defect they sold the car with. Now I currently have a car that at 121k miles is having the death rattle yet again, loss of performance, possibly trashed turbo due to their also poor choice in a turbo oil line and a ticking time bomb of a car. Only reason I continue to keep this car is I have negative equity on it from the terrible resale value of this car. Do yourself a favor, don't get lost in the ""cuteness"" or handling of this car and run far, far away.

The Duramax is one great engine .. but the problem is still the lb7 injectors.. being under the valve covers.. and yes under everything else too.. injector replacement cost is min 3k to 5k.. and they have been replaced 5 times..  Three Times under warranty one time half the cost under a bosch exception and the last time at my cost.. The warranty on injectors is normally 1 year unlimited miles thru a good diesel shop.. Thru my travels my injectors last 40 to 50k miles.  I drive that in two years.. I have been procrasting the needed injector change now..  The bosch shop says that bosch will provide me with a exception again.. but it is still Thousands out of my pocket..  I was also sold the Air Dog fuel management system.. being told that I will get 200k+ on a set of injectors..  Unfortunately its been a Con game.  There should be a class action lawsuit..,0

Rust Bucket,0
"Besides the Ford sucking because it's a Ford... they put a small 4cyl engine in a hauling vehicle. The cabin isn't sound resistant at all! The suspension is so hard, you can feel each vein pop on a bug when you run one over. Extremely uncomfortable ride. At only 51,000 miles, the front end needs replacing already. 51,000 miles. What a joke. (Oh and Ford says it's out of warranty due to mileage) of course it is! They knew their product wouldn't last so they only give you a tail light warranty compared to EVERY OTHER DEALER!",0
"From day one I had nothing but trouble with my vehicle, the sunroofs leaked (and while under warranty I was told ""well it is kind of a California car) that could not be fixed, next came the radiator which cost me thousands.
There were other smaller concerns that appeared to me to be design flaws and poor craftsmen's work.
While the exterior looks nice the over impression I got was that this particular model was not designed well nor put together well.

I have since sold it and will never buy from GM again.",0
its in the shop more than on the road,0

Eh,0
This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Do an internet search on all of the issues the 6.0 diesel engine has BEFORE you buy one.,0
"Serious design flaw with the cables running on pulleys in the sliding doors which open and close them.  When (not if) the cables or pulleys break, the door can be stuck in the open position.  Think about that with your kid in a carseat and it breaks while you are miles from home at the grocery store. Dealer wants >$2k to fix.  I bought the entire motor assembly and replaced the driverside one when that was the only way to get parts.  Then they extended the coverage and our other door made it just under that but they charged my wife for hinges and other BS to recoup the costs.  The driver's door is broken again.  Now, you can buy a replacement cable assembly (which they should have made initially given the poor design).  The door has been broke and closed for 1-1/2 years now so not sure I will fix it.

Second issue was with a poor prep job on the rims.  They were not cleaned properly by Toyota prior to putting on the smooth clear coat.  It started flaking off not much after the warranty ran out.  Dealer did not want to deal with it and tried to come up with reasons how we did it.  My wife can't believe Toyota does not have more integrity or pride in the cars they build.  She drives it and when anybody asks, she explains Toyota's deal which is really bad advertising on Toyota's part.

Lastly is changing the timing belt and water pump.  There is a bolt which goes thru a bracket which is the difference between a reasonable bill for doing the work and an exorbitant amount.  The design causes it to seize & break.  After changing it the first time, I requested to put anti-seize on it to make sure it did not happen again.  Second time we split the cost (I think they doubled it or increased it a bunch then agreed to split it 75/25%) only because I made a stink about the bad design and how if they would have followed my request I would not have had to pay for any additional cost.

But the electronics are absolutely terrible. The GPS system is very un-intuitive. None (GPS & audio, window controls, steering wheel buttons, tailgate control, etc) of the buttons have worked on the first press, and generally you need to hold the button for a second or 2 for it to realize its being pressed.

Changing stations on FM, AM, or Sirius takes FOR EVER. Give it 5 seconds to change one frequency (or station), just to change to another. There is no way to scroll through the stations quickly, so you'd have to go through every single station and wait 5 seconds every time you press that button that only works half the time (as described in the last paragraph)

Also, what a stupid, stupid, STUPID spot for an AUX port to listen to music from. Its in the glove box, so whenever the driver wants to listen to music he or she has to lean over to the passenger side to get the cord. And you can't just shut the glove box while using the AUX cord, so it must also be stored in the glove box every time (creating that ""leaning to the passenger side"" I just talked about).

The tail lights - The sockets that power the bulbs are a poor design that can't be fixed. I've completely replaced the sockets 3 times (and fuses, not knowing what was wrong the first time) and I'm still having the same problem where the idle lights and brake lights don't get power to the bulb.

The windows - When trying to put them up or down automatically, they go all the way up or down, and change their minds to go back the other direction they came from. Now I need to find the right spot in the button (when they don't go up automatically, so I have to keep my finger on the button) and do this whenever the windows malfunction.

Steering wheel controls - They were replaced for free while the car was on warranty, but they used to mess things up. you'd turn up your stereo and your windshield wipers came on. You'd change your dashboard display and you turned on your high beams on. You'd turn on your turn signal and you've waited 5 seconds to change radio stations. These constantly changed, so it was very annoying. But luckily this happened while the car was on warranty.

"This car single handedly made me detest all things Chrysler.  In my three years of owning the car the following things broke...

Power Steering
Tie Rods (twice) which lead to 6 tires in 6 months
A/C
Brakes - rotors and pads which could be considered normal wear and tear as opposed to...
Transmission (wouldn't get out of first gear)
Drivers seat

The seat was the part that made me hate Chrysler... see... there is a recall on 94 models of this car for faulty seat welds on the power driver's seat assembly.  My 95 model had the seat welds fail and while I was driving 25mph, all of a sudden I was looking at the ceiling.  When brought to the attention of Chrysler, they would not consider doing anything to accommodate.  The part cost 700 dollars plus 400 to reupholster the seat.  Faulty part, that lead me to driving the car with a bucket on the floor of the back seats to hold the drivers set up.  Could have been much worse if I was ever in an accident like that but I'm sure Chrysler wouldn't care.  One customer service rep suggested that I consider buying a new chrysler... my response was that if she gave me a free one, I would light it on fire on the front lawn of the campus because that would be safer than driving one of their products for an extended period of time.  Seriously, walk before buying one of these.  Buy a bike.  Hitchhike... its safer to get in a car with a complete stranger than to drive this vehicle.  (not seriously but you know what I mean, not condoning hitchhiking)  Don't get this car.  Don't take one for free.",0

Here's a dashcam video of our 2011, at the time with around 15,000 miles, experiencing death wobble.  For those who haven't experienced it, it is rather alarming. It manifests as a violent resonant front end shake that amplifies quickly. If you do not reduce speed fast (to about 45 mph), recovery is impossible and you will have a very bad day.

We took it to the dealer, they blamed tire pressure. Checked it? Perfect. Must be alignment. Checked? Perfect. Loose suspension parts? Nope. You can then begin to pay out the nose for them to ""diagnose"" the issue, taking seemingly random stabs at a solution. Google reveals owners who've spent many thousands without a solution.

Face facts Ford, this is a design flaw.  The fact that it hits a relatively small percentage of the vehicles is very little consolation to those of us who own one of them.  Every highway drive is a roulette spin.  You can drive 1000 miles with no issue, until you hit that (minor) bridge seam at just the right angle, at just the right speed, and you are suddenly losing control of the vehicle.

"I bought the 2016 MDX at Apr 2015 and I really regret.

When I test drove the car I felt the new 2016 MDX has obviously stronger new car smell than 2015 MDX. I noticed it on almost all the 2016 MDX I tried at Apr 2015. I made a big mistake that I  think every car has strong new car smell will disappear after several months. But I am wrong.

This awful car keeps giving off smell for 1.5 years even after two summers. During this period, I always drive it with window open. But it doesn't help.

Finally I figure out that it's the ""genuine leather"" seats which are giving off this chemical smell. Personally I like the genuine leather smell. If you buy a coach leather bag, there must be leather smell and sometime it's strong. But the leather pieces on the MDX seats are different. It's giving off  very unpleasant chemical smell. It's not typical leather smell.

And if you look at the seats, only the pieces that can be directly touched are made with ""genuine leather"" the other pieces are faux leather. The faux leathers has no smell. Only the ""genuine leather"" are junk.

I would like to warn everybody who want to buy Acura cars, if you can detect the leather smell at the beginning, please don't expect it will disappear in short time. It will last long long long time. And it's toxic.

I am going to sell my car.  It seems we have no way to prevent these manufactures making toxic products right now. Please just be very careful if you want to buy the car to drive your little kids.",0
I am the first owner of a 2007 Nissan Quest and my fuel gauge all of a sudden did not work. I only found out it did not work after running out of gas 3 times. The fuel gauge would read 1/4 tank and would stall and not start. This happened at the 90K odometer reading. So I just lived with it. The check engine light was always on. I had trouble passing smog inspection two times because of it. I finally had to replace the whole instrumentt panel to pass smog in 2015. At the end of 2015 Nissan had a recall for the faulty fuel gauge. By that time I fixed the problem. I took it to the dealer for the recall work and I told them all the work I had done. I even wrote a letter detailing all that I went through and all my expenses and inconvenience because of their faulty fuel gauge. The response was they were not at fault. I completely disagree and won't buy another Nissan car in the future.,0

I tried to call but there's a protocol, and you DON'T get to talk to anyone above the number twelve person, but you don't just place a call that would make too much sense.

I bought the VW for my daughter. She and her boyfriend ran it through the woods doing the dune buggy thing. When I got divorced I inherited it back. It is not my choice of cars.
One thing I've always hated on this car is the structural struts that run from the roof to the body of the car. They are a huge blind spot. You have to be at the top of your game with this car. Always looking twice or three times.
The brakes have never been replaced. Quite impressive. The struts need to be replaced. There's a hole in the exhaust. The check engine light has been on for 200,000 miles. The windshield has not one, but two cracks. It's been this way for seven or eight years.
It was black originally. Now it is oxidized grey/white.
The VW symbol in the front; the aluminum foil came off part of it and it shows the plastic underneath. The VW symbol on the back of the hatch never hides the lock, its always stuck upside down.
This VW came with a cassette player, yeah you read that right. I've never used it. The radio antenna rusted off long ago. The VW dealership wanted a hundred bucks for that antenna. Ain't no way that's going to happen.
The plastic latch that opens the hood broke and the VW dealership charged me 35 bucks for that plastic part.
I despise, loathe, hate, and slam the VW dealership every chance I get.
Early on one of the headlights went out. The dealer charged 60 bucks for replacing the bulb. I asked why it was soooo expensive. ""We have to take off the fenders to change the headlights."" That's a blatant lie. I can now change the light bulb in less than 15 minutes.
I changed out the battery and when I wen to start the car the security alarm went off. I couldn't get it to stop. I called the dealership and was told, ""We'll have to tow it in and reprogram the computer."" I went inside and googled my problem. In five minutes I found the solution. ""Open the hatch with the key and it will disable the security alarm."" It worked. Man, I hate the dealership.

3) The self-driving features are a joke, very weak, limited and much worse than the Model S. Tesla failed to disclose these problems
4) Tesla likes to make their customers do their quality control work without paying them

"Can I give it zero stars? Look at this video: [...] or do an internet search for ""F250 death wobble"".  The NHTSA video (file number PE07-057) shows very well what occurs with my vehicle.  The problem is very disconcerting as it occurs only at speeds above about 65 MPH.  It occurs at high speed when a front tire hits a bump or pothole. I can only imagine what would happen if I was pulling a full load when it happened. I spent over $50,000 for this vehicle new and have spent hundreds of dollars to try to fix Ford's problem in multiple visits to an external front end shop.

Reviewing the NHTSA web site indicates that Ford has known about this problem for years but has done nothing to fix it.  I contacted Ford Motor Company directly and they told me to contact a dealer.  Two Ford dealers (one in Texas, one in California) told me that Ford could not fix it and suggested I go to an independent front end shop to get a stiffer steering damper installed.  The shop looked at my truck and concluded that everything was to spec with the front end and installed a new steering damper. The first one did not fix the problem so he installed a stiffer one and the problem has not re-occurred.  The NHTSA web site includes a Ford Technical Service Bulletin from 2007 that suggests the dealer verify the tire pressure, followed by replacing the steering damper, tightening steering / suspension bolts, and adjusting alignment.  None of that indicates that Ford knows an effective corrective action to the problem.

I'm done with Ford.  I purchased a 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 last year and could not be happier with it - the Chevy truck gets 5 stars.",0
Alternator went out after 9 months of ownership as a new car. Every exterior bulb has been replaced at least twice. The paint on the hood and right rocker panel bubbled so now there is rust. The dealership said it wasn't under warranty even though the car was only a year old. The battery is mounted by the driver side front wheel - makes for expensive replacement unless you know what you're doing. The headliner is falling off. #POS,0
I will never order from The Wire Zone ever again and I will make sure all my friends and aqaintences don't either,0
The head lights on this are the worst ever. Drive any car you are buying at night. With the new style on these you can not see large game if they are on the side of the road or even on the road. With 44 years of driving experience in areas with lots of large game I have never hit a animal until driving this car. I only had 1-2 seconds notice before impacting it at 65 mph. I could only see it from the shoulders down. When I contacted Acura it was clear all they are doing is documenting for the civil suit that will come when someone is killed because of this. If I could give this a negative I would.,0
Nothing good to say about  this car.,0
The seat covers did not fit the seats too tight wouldn't go over top part at all. The truck is a f150 regency model.,0
The product never worked up to now the car don't start regardless to how much we try recode it,0
"This truck will cost you a lot of money in repairs. The timing chains required replacement at 47K miles because of defective secondary timing chain tensioners. There was a whirring There was a technical service bulletin available from Nissan, however they would not cover the cost of the repair.  The abs module went defective at 50k. I take great care of my vehicles. I change fluids at the correct intervals, change tires on the early side and I keep them clean. Don't buy a Nissan truck. The company puts in crappy parts to save a few bucks which will cost you in the long run.  Buy a Toyota or Honda if you are looking for a smaller truck.",0
They didn't fit my jeep.,0
"The truck vibrates at highway speeds has been in the shop three times in two weeks has had a brand new set of tires installed at 10,000 miles going back in the shop next week for the vibration  The front tire rod and jam not I found loose yesterday and traded to wobbly steering in front wheel vibration to me a hunk of crap and expensive house of crap no one by any of these ever ever ever ever I've been a lifelong ram person but after this never again",0
"3.0 and 4.0 Every one (I've had 4) had cracked heads, loses coolant water, never got better than 19 mpg on cruise control on highway. My 3/4 ton diesel gets 22 mpg and its got 750 hp.
Throwaway pickups. Cheap to buy, simple to throw out.",0
"This car has been nothing but garbage. It has costed a bunch of money already in the first week I've had it. It obviously burns oil like crazy, a common issue with these cars. It is loud inside the car and it seems like everything is made extremely cheap. Hardly any of the windows work due to bad switches, window tracks and motors. I don't recommend this vehicle to anyone for any type of driving. No matter how much work I put into it there's always something that needs replaced or fixed. The only thing I have liked so far is the air conditioning works well and the sunroof actually works and doesn't leak. I owned the car for 6 days and immediately went and got a newer vehicle from a dealership.",0
Will not link with the vehicle,0
"I hate the car. There's a blind spot on both sides. Extremely difficult to see what's coming on both sides. The navigation screen is very small and difficult to view when driving. About the size ofy cell phone screen. Basically the car is terribly over priced. I had a Honda pilot before and there isn't any comparison between cars. I've had Toyota's and Lexus before so it's not like I didn't know what I was buying but I never expected it to be this bad. I've had the car three months and I have 15,000 miles on it and I intend to dump it this spring.  The only plus it has is the towing ability but I would have been better off buying an F150. All Toyota is doing is raising the price every year with no improvements.",0
"At 2500 miles front wheel bearing needed replacing. Currently at 15,000 miles and it has been to the dealer for repair 4 more times for various fuel and electrical problems. Battery still drains completely within 4 days without driving. Dealer still cannot find the issue. Slow acceleration. Diesel pulling performance worse than my 2011 Ford and 2008 Dodge. It's not even close. I will say the ride is better than Ford or Dodge.",0
"Beautiful truck,5.4 motor is a piece of junk,cost 7500.00 to repair,Transmission replaced 2 times,starter replaced and alternater and catalytic converters replaced. It only has 131,000 miles",0
"Besides the numerous recalls, this car required a new transmission after 10,000 miles, the rear hatch didn't work - there was always something broken. I literally - not figuratively - spent more time behind the wheel of a rental car (while this one was in the shop) than I did behind the Cherokee Trailhawk. It's the third Jeep I've owned, and my last. Oh, by the way, it really didn't have much storage space. I traded it in at 14,000 miles for a Subaru Outback.",0
"I purchased a 2013 f150 FTX that was just 5yrs old with 66000 mi. The truck looked near perfect inside and out and appeared to be well cared for. In the 4months Ive had it Ive had to replace a radiator hose, a water pump and put a complete new brakes on the front including calipers. Now I am trying to figure out why the rear end is shaking and bouncing. (Its not the tires. Already ruled that out)
So far Im not too happy with the truck. I keep thinking I could have bought a newer Silverado and it would have been cheaper to own at this point with the higher payments . I do like the look of the truck, and the cab, and the ride is awesome when its not shaking. Im hoping that after Im done fixing the bounce it will all have be worth it, the truck will be reliable,  and Ill not have to lose a lot of $ trading it in.",0
"At 83,000 miles truck started the ever so popular limp mode. Where you can push the gas to the floor and all the truck will do is move at an idle  I was almost ran over by an 18 wheeler because of this happening. Not happy with this truck. This is the ecoboost model.",0
"Ford -F-150 Platinum to be exact. For me it's the best looking truck on the road. The truck has all the bells and whistles. My truck has the V8 engine and has ample power.  However,  I give it a 2 star rating due to the following:
-  Sunroof top came off the rails and had to be repaired at dealership (warranty covered)
-  When making hard left hand turns you can sometimes hear noise from the front end.  Dealership ensured me there were no mechanical issues. (no repairs made)
- $$$$$$ I had to have one of the cylinder heads replaced at 62,000 miles.  Truck was just out of warranty and not covered by Ford warranty.  This should not have happened on a relatively new truck.  I have never been a fan of extended warranties, but in this case it bit me in the backside.",0
"I have always been a Ford man; however, they really screwed me on this truck. I bought it new and white. Ford has a major problem with their white vehicles. They get rust specs all over the truck in less than 2 years. My brother bought his new, and has the same problem. The dealership will buff it out and send you home, until the warranty runs out. Think twice. This problem is well documented on the internet. I'm ready for a new truck. For the first time, I don't think that it will be Ford.",0
"This is absolutely the lowest quality truck I have ever owned ant the dealer's customer service is even worse.
They did 4 brake jobs on the truck before the 36,000 mile warrantee expired. I did the 5th. The dealer's service department belongs in a salvage yard. Not one legitimate mechanic in the place. They have screwed up so many repairs on this truck that I wouldn't even trust them to put gas in my lawnmower much less lay another hand on this $40,000 garage space wasting Junker.",0
"I really like the physical size, ergonomics and features of my Lariat.  I have owned a 2002 GMC Sierra and a similarly equipped 2007 Toyota Tundra and this one is the most luxurious and smooth riding of the three.

Unfortunately, it is not nearly as well engineered and constructed as the other two.  I take very good care of my vehicles ensuring that they all receive the required maintenance and full synthetic oil changes so that's not a factor.

I had near zero repair issues with the other two trucks.  The GMC had a door seal that had to be replaced and the Tundra had a small part in the tail gate latch break.  That was it except for tires and both were pushing 90K miles when I replaced them.

The F-150 has under 60K miles on it currently.  The SYNC system had enough repeated issues that it triggered a Lemon Law complaint that was eventually settled by Ford with a free 75K extended warranty.  The front brake rotors have both warped and had to be ground flat.  Unfortunately, Ford didn't replace them.  It is on its fourth battery all of which have been under warranty.

I plan to keep it until it has 75K on the odometer and the extended warranty if complete.  I then plan to trade it for a Ram 1500 or GMC/Chevy 1500.",0
Very good quality truck.  It has never let me down.,0
Truck had a engine knock which ford garage refused to fix. I just traded it in on a new GMC Sierra last week. It was the 5.0 v8. 4 different dealers. Just watch 5.0 engine knock on YouTube to hear em. There's many people's videos. Oil changed at dealer every 4k.,0
"This jeep looks nice but need more things replaced on it like the rest of the roll bar pads , doors , bikini top, spare tire rack, side step and other things .I like the lift and big tires and wheels.",0
Just hard to find parts not much to choose from there is way more parts to choose form out there,0
Lots of Electrical issues and now even after replacing fuel pump and all the fuel relays I am still not getting any fuel to the engine. Good strong engine and transmission I have the RWD. For over 75k miles I have been fighting bad grounds and faulty wiring the whole way.,0
"I used to own one of these trucks. A four cylinder with a five speed manual 4wd.

The trucks are not necessarily bad. Their size means they are agile. They can go places no other truck can. Their high ground clearance for their size makes them good off road and the low range handles hills with ease. They get great fuel economy too.

My problem with these trucks is they ride terribly. Very bumpy. Although the wngines can be modified to make good power stock they are incredibly sluggish for their size and weight class.

But the big thing is the frames. These trucks have a known issue with the frames rotting right out from under them. They were recalled but many if not most of the trucks were not taken in. The time limit for that recall has passed. Buyers and owners should beware those that were not fixed. They are outright dangerous. All should be checked before purchase and those who own them should inspect for rush issues.

Mine was owned by my family for several years. We were not made aware off the recall and the frame broke nearly in half. Thankfully not on the highway I was driving on hours beforehand or I would not be here.

If however you should find yourself with one that the frame has been replaced it will likely outlast you no matter what punishment you put it through. For that I rate it two stars instead of one.",0
Had to junk it.,0
"I would not own this truck if it weren't for the drivetrain.  The Cummins engine, heavy duty 5 speed manual gearbox, Dana 60 front axle and Dana 80 rear axle make it worthwhile.  But, the Dodge truck itself is low quality and has been frustrating to live with.  The cheap paint has been flaking off for years.  The tin foil they used for chrome on the grill shell has wrinkled and is starting to peel off leaving spots of gray plastic showing through.  The decorative plastic side trim has discolored and is now starting to separate from the truck body.  The interior components, such as the dashboard, are cheap and look like the injection molded junk they are.  The radio has never been capable of good reception and there are no dash mounted speakers.  I have had problems with the headlight switch burning out several times.  The headlights themselves are nothing more than cheap plastic and mine are in need of replacement.
One of the inner headlight buckets broke just from road vibration and now road splash gets in and burns out the bulbs.  I can't drive at night in the rain!  I could go on, but by now you get the idea.",0
It's really not the greatest vehicle to own. But fixing it is pretty cheap.,0

"This truck apparently has the worst automatic transmission ever made. I've owned trucks of various makes all my life and have never had to replace a transmission until I bought a 1997 Dodge Ram 1500. I don't even carry much weight or haul heavy trailers but I am on my third transmission. When this one breaks (as I am sure it will) I will part out the truck. Oh, who in Hell thought it was a good idea to bury the heater core so deep that you literally must pull the entire dash assembly out to replace it? Never Again.",0
"From day one things tended to go wrong on this truck.  First recall was for wheel lugs being too short and had to be replaced.  Second, a real joke --the cruise control switch associated with the brake master cylinder could catch the vehicle on fire and the fix -- put in a fusible link to kill power when the switch cracked. Wonder why they did not replace the defective switch design with another found on other models of Ford vehicles.  Even though the truck was in warranty, when the oxygen sensor quit working it cost almost $400 to replace it -- which takes a $70 retail price part plus 6 minutes to replace the part with a new one.  At least that is what it took me to replace the second and third oxygen sensors.  I had to buy a code reader so I could read, analyze, and clear the trouble codes that continuously show up as ""check engine"" lights.  It is 19 years old now and the driver door window does not go up/down (electric), the passenger side window sporadically works, the driver side door mirror is cracked from ice expansion, the transmission shifter on the steering column is broken.",0
"Good running vehicle. Lots of power. Pulled a 30ft camper no problems. comfortable. good style.
Loved my expedition up until it blew a spark plug out of the #3 cylinder. From what I have read it is a common problem. The aluminum heads are crap and easy to damage the threads for the plugs as what is the most likely reason for the failure in my vehicle from the previous owner/owners pore maintenance. Other than that for a vehicle with over 21X,XXX miles it was the only real issue besides the how much of a pain in the A$$ it is to change the coil packs and plugs in the #3 and 4 cylinders.
Air suspension is crap as well. Junk it and replace with coil springs. Easy to do and costs hardly nothing if you do it your self and get the springs from the junk yard.",0
it cost way too much in upkeep. it has been a money drain on me.,0
"Got this car for $275 dollars as a daughter car.  Has run fine from 110k to 140k but air con condenser died. Blend doors for air con was an expensive $1200. Door actuators are all gone, only rear power windows roll up without help. It's no Toyota but great teenager vehicle .",0

"Mechanically, this thing is a BEAST!  The problems come in the shortcuts that GM seems to have taken all over this freaking vehicle. My biggest beef is the electrical system!  OK, with wonderful government mandates requiring more and more computer running of the system, one place that simply cannot be skimped on is the wiring!  However, that's exactly what GM has done.  Starting at a fairly young age the truck suffered from a very inferior ""security system"", causing it to not want to start.  This is a fairly widespread problem when you start looking into it.  In fact, talk to GM/Chevy owners.  Odds are you know at least 1 person who has suffered from the security problem having to ""reset"" the system from time to time.  Inferior gaskets are also a problem.  Plastic, REALLY?  Luckily between me and my father we were able to tear down and redo the intake manifold gasket in a day so it wasn't quite as big of a deal as it could have been.  I just got lucky the coolant was leaking OUTSIDE of the engine and not into the engine.  All in all, I'm sorry I purchased this truck.  It has consistently not been a reliable vehicle except for about the first two years.  I guess that's the goal.  Overcharge for your vehicles, make sure they die early, and hope they come back for more.  Not that I've had any better luck with Ford.  They aren't even mechanically sound!",0
Good car but had to rebuild transmission these Hondas had a defective tranny. Had to replace engine also due to defect causing oil to leak into coolant passages from hairline crack in cylinder wall. But all is good now.,0
"This car started off well, no complaints when it comes to performance.  However, do expect the transmission to go out and it needing to be replaced at about year 12.  This seems to be a pervasive problem for Honda Accords.",0

Because of that the jeep is a lousy everyday driver, It also died on me on a 4x4 trail do to a crankshaft position sensor. The other problems with Jeep Wranglers are lousy performance they have none and poor gas mileage as well. They also are no good for highway driving due to the height and short body ,making them unstable at high speed. My Jeep is only good for one thing and that is 4x4 trails in the mountains. This is not a practical vehicle in any way , and the only reason I keep it is because I can not afford another car that is worth trading on this Jeep.",0

Good if you can find one that was taken care of.,0
"These trucks have been plagued with issues. The biggest problem is the timing chain guides. They were made of poor construction and can break anywhere between 80k on. When this happens you bend valves. And it's 3k to fix since you have to pull the engine out of the truck. Other things like AC issues with blend door, front axes leaking, stereo display burns out, rear shackles rot just to name a few. But some of these can run forever. I have 1 with 284k on it and still going. It's the luck of the draw.",0
transmission died after only 152000 miles.,0
"I bought this car used for my son to drive.  It has over 200,000 miles. I had to pull the engine and transmission to replace the crankshaft timing sprocket and harmonic balancer because the engine slipped out of time.  While having the entire drive train out I replaced all the oil seals, gaskets and coolant seals in the engine and transaxle. I also rebuilt the power steering pump and had to replace the starter.

Car rides and drives nicely but at its a bit of a maintenance money pit.  I have had to replace the alternator, valve cover gaskets, brakes, reseal drive alxes, replace wheel bearings on front. I have had repeated and ongoing issues with the upstream Oxygen Sensor 1 bank 2 throwing check engine codes P0138 and P0139.

 Sure it's a high mileage vehicle but it takes alot of parts and my shade tree mechanic time and effort to keep it going.  I will not own another one of these cars.",0

"Lariat pkg, so had all the goodies but was unfortunately equipped the International Powerstroke 6.0 liter boat anchor for an engine. This was an attempt to get more power and better mileage out of a lighter diesel engine. What resulted were endless recalls and expenslve problems including breaking head bolts, gasket failures, main pump failures, main seal failures, lower block cracking, and the list goes on. At 97000 miles, low for a diesel, I had to dump $6k into an engine rebuild. Previously, Ford built the same truck with a 7.3 liter diesel that was trouble-free and had an average service life of over 300k miles. The 6.0 was supposed to be an improvement. Instead it hss been a performance and financial ball and chain. After the $6k engine rebuild I promptly sold the truck-at a loss- and returned to Chevrolet. I got 11 years and 212000 miles out of my laast Silverado and all I had to do was periodic oul changes!",0

"Traded for in May 2017, allegedly only problem was blown headgaskets, ended up being gaskets and both cylinder heads cracked, done complete rebuild of motor plus repaired frame, cleaned, repainted complete frame, replaced rear brake lines, frame now in excellent shape and motor runs perfect, drove about 200 miles done oil change, automatic transmission did not seem right then started slipping some during shifts, procured 5R55E transmission to replace old transmission, currently in process of changing, also neighbor asked what was making a roaring noise, thought it may have been power steering pump but ended up noise was coming from rear differential also after driving it would be very warm to touch, rear driver side axle started leaking 90wt oil, bearing was somewhat worn but when I miked axle seal surface was out of round so I am replacing axle, bearings and seals on drivers side and bearings and seals on passengers side also new shoes on drivers side as oil leak ruined shoes I had already replaced shoes during restoration plus new brake hardware, plus new pads on front, new CV axle on passengers side, rotor resurfaced, calipers cleaned and repainted, I had forget I also replaced radiator during engine rebuild, new rear bumper was fabricated as a replacement was not available for the step side bed, during repair of differential it was discovered that backlash of carrier was excessive and has been corrected hopefully that will take care of roaring noise and maybe transmission change will improve drivability, is looking like this vehicle will be almost completely rebuilt by the time I get finished. I may add more later ?",0
"When I bought mine, I was young and it was all I could afford. I since traded it in, but had it for over a decade.

Pros:
* Inexpensive
* Parts are plentiful and inexpensive
* Repairs are cheap
* Rangers will drive literally forever: I am sure there will still be some on the road when the Sun swallows the Earth in a billion years.

Cons:
* Mine was 2WD - combined with its low curb weight, I have been stuck in snow and mud multiple times
* Cabin space is tight
* Only two seats
* Anemic power compared to other trucks, even with the larger engines

Okays:
* 6' box is actually longer than some modern full-size trucks, but it is a bit shallow, balancing out pro/con.

I guess if you need a beater to drive to work, or something cheap to haul large but light items (maybe hauling washing machines around) it would be economical. If I wanted a light truck to drive every day that cost less than a new full-size, I would look for a gently used (three years old or newer) modern compact truck like a Tacoma or Colorado. It will certainly cost more than an old Ranger, but will have a lot more power, modern amenities like infotainment and XM radio, more efficient drivetrain, and a bigger box.

While I am grateful to have had dependable transportation for so long, I do not miss my old Ranger one bit.

The only real problems I had with mine were caused by disuse. I would leave it parked for a month at a time, which took its toll by draining the battery among other things. I can't blame Ford for that. When I drove it regularly it was fairly solid, requiring only routine maintenance: oil, brakes, tires, new clutch after 120k miles, etc.",0

NO  I also had a 1999 Silverado z71 totally loaded with the same results. My 2000 Chevrolet has 56,000 miles on it and it has had 4 sets of rotors, 4 master cylinders and 2 sets of brake lines.

"I love driving this car. The power is great and handling is sharp but my problem is with the design on the engine compartment. The drain plug around the brake booster is impossible to get to and can be clogged with debris. If this happens you can kiss your engine goodbye when it fills with water. I've been a victim of this, it hurts when your beloved car dies.",0
"Not a bad vehicle, except for the engine.  It seems the only thing they did right was use a timing chain instead of a belt, but if they wanted to do that really right, it would have been gears.  The intake manifold gasket is guaranteed to blow and leak coolant into the cylinders, causing overheating. The radiator fan doesn't come on until it's about ready to melt down.  The whole coolant system was designed by a moron: parts of it are higher than the radiator cap, so you literally can't fill it properly without special equipment.  Elementary physics, folks; engineers should know that.  And of course, they used cheap nylon fittings that are guaranteed to break down and crack, but they're all trying to cut corners, aren't they?  You need to remove part of the exhaust system to replace the thermostat, $200 or so at a shop for what should be a five-minute job in your driveway.  You can't get to the rear spark plugs without removing engine mounts and tilting the engine; it was just crammed into a space obviously not designed for it.  As I said, other than all that, not a bad vehicle.",0

"I've owned the generation 6 civic and now the generation 7, both purchased at 120k miles.  The 01 Gen 7 has been a steady stream of repairs starting with the gauge cluster, CAT, alternator, ECU, O2 sensor in addition to electrical problems that have kept the AC from working and the cruise control from working during hot weather.  Add in to wear and tear items, bearings brakes shocks struts, electric window and door lock issues etc all in the first 100k miles I've put on the vehicle.  The Gen 6 issues were all wear and tear items with just a CAT/O2 sensor replacement that I was able to put 388k miles on before the engine went.",0

The 2 liter split port engine is fairly peppy and is good enough for everyday driving.

Both of these lines rusted from the inside out. I lost my brake lines about 5-7 years ago. I then lost my fuel lines 2 years later. The materiel used in the connection of these lines apparently caused electrolysis to occur between two metal types -- result -- internal rust. GM denies though you can google and find hundreds of folks with my same issue. BTW -- I have not operated the truck in any zone considered ""high-salt"" during winter months.",0

The oil pickup tube can and will eventually clog which causes a drop in oil pressure and catastrophic engine failure if not addressed.

I have the 2002 Ford Focus SE with the 2.0L Split Port engine and let me tell you it is a Peace of junk. I do every maintenance on my cars that i have owned and this is a the worst car to work on. I just had to replace the Alternator and it sits under a power steering pump and the only way i was to replace the Alternator was to remove the Radiator fan to get more room. I have to replace all 3 motor mounts on the car because the Engine is now sagging. Because the Hydraulic Mount have failed. I have never heard of using Hydraulic Mount for a engine its like they wanted you to have to replace them in the future.,0
"My 2002 Ford Focus ZTS was a decent car for a number of years, but eventually started to develop maddening electrical problems that even numerous auto electic shops could not figure out.

I took really good care of the car and had hoped to drive it past 200k miles,  but at 125k repair costs were becoming more than the car was worth. Would I buy another Ford product? Well, I bought a new 2011 Honda Civic that has had zero issues in 75k miles, a 2015 Mazda3 for my daughter and a 2016 Hyundai Elantra for my wife, so no, I would never buy another Ford.",0
"I would definitely do lots of research before buying 2002 Jetta. She has many problems.
I bought mine used with 163,000 miles on it and had to replace the transmission after driving 6 months. That was about $2500. The water pump goes out every 80,000 miles; which has to be changed a month after I bought.  This cost about $380 (because you might as will change the timing belt, since you have to take it off anyway.)  The coil pack I have replaced 5 times in the last 5 years. The first was from the recall that the previous owner never took care of and so I have had to change at least once a year since.
After sinking so much money in her, its hard not to keep her.  She is pretty though, they did that right.",0

The 2.5 l engine also needed head gaskets replaced.  Outer finish is just starting to get rust. Other inside issues are: fuel release door lever rusted, top console latch broke, power window motors sluggish on front windows and door weatherstripping needed replacing. Only 165,000 miles on it, so I'm hoping I can get many more miles on it, but not if things keep needing repair! Considering the mileage, this is the worst car I've owned for cost of repairs.",0
This car was my biggest mistake to buy.  When the Altima is not taken care of everything goes bad.  The previous owner had it looking good in the outside and barely running it so he can sell it.  I bought it and regret it.  Not buying a Nissan ever again.,0
Too many rust issues,0
"I know Ill upset diehard owners, but this is just a review of my personal experience
with the Chevy trucks I have owned. These are things Id wish Id know before buying them, or I may have weighed the other options.
I want to like Chevy trucks. Theyre tough, parts are easy to find (thats for a reason), the engines run well and if made well, have the potential to be incredibly dependable.
Unfortunately, having owned numerous vehicle makes since I was a teenager and having to work on my own cars when they had issues, being on my second early 2000s Silverado, I see why GM falls way behind in reliability of their products.
Google Castech Head Bulletin and youll see what Im talking about.
Knowingly creating a bulletin that the heads you put in your trucks are defective, while offering no solution but to stick the owner with the cost of replacing the heads if lucky or the entire engine, which is my case.
I am in the process of dropping $4500 on a used engine into a truck thats 15 years old and has only 149k miles. Only reason is because body wise, the truck is in superb shape and its cheaper than a car payment right now.
Just baffled.
Just make sure when you purchase one, you scrutinize every detail of rust- as they rust incredibly fast if let go- and for the 706 Castech heads which is easy to see just by looking on the bottom right of the top of the cylinder head. Check the coolant tank for scalding, oil for coolant, etc.",0

Okay at best but avoid this vehicle. You will definitely be putting a lot of money into repairs.,0
"Bought this car with 80k miles, it currently sits at 160k miles. I've maintained it, just like my other cars. I've owned Toyota and Nissan, and both went 200K miles with no major issues. This car just falls apart after it reaches about 120k miles.
-Fuel Pump Assembly cracked and leaked. Replaced with new OEM ~$290
-A/C Compressor grenaded itself, had to replace entire system due to metal contamination. ~$1000.
-TPS failed-replaced with K-Tuned twice (Also a POS). ~$150
-Hood latch broke ~$200 since I had to get it painted and welded. Nice design, Honda.
-3rd grinds/pops out/ doesn't go in.
-Driver side window motor broken
-Door Actuator broke
-Clear Coat is failing on the hood and roof. Despite being washed and waxed regularly.
-Honda Leather is bad quality. It's tearing and really worn, despite maintaining it with Lexol.
-Stock CD player stopped working.
-It likes to burn oil, like no other car I've owned.
-Car left me stranded when car decided not to go into gear anymore. (Clutch disk fell apart internally)

Despite this, I do love the styling and decent gas mileage. Engine still runs well, despite it's high miles.

"This truck has a lot of small things that are very aggravating to live with. The cruise control rubber covers dried up and fell apart. The mirror switch is going bad. The door locks need to be constantly lubricated because of what feels like a burr in the mechanism that when ""dry"" prevents unlocking them. Both doors. The electric lock is iffy. The seats don't come forward enough to put anything of any size in the cab. It has a crappy plastic/aluminum radiator. The oil filter is the hardest to replace of any vehicle I've owned. I'd give it a 2.5 star rating if I could because except for the radiator problem it has never stranded me. To reiterate: bad seat slider design, door locks, and cruise control buttons along with the cheap radiator make this one to avoid if you cherish your sanity. The door locks alone can really get you fuming!",0
"Does the job of a big pickup, but is the worst vehicle i have ever owned.  If I could afford a replacement I would get one.  It rides rough, and I mean back breaking harsh.

"Car works fine for local travel. Torque converter will strip pump splines and won't move an inch. No warning. Should have been recalled but Ford was too cheap. Trans will have to be removed. I had to have mine towed over 600 miles, ouch. Just type in 2003 Taurus torque converter on internet and check it out. The new converters have a much heaver spline plate. Ford knew about this.",0
The years between 2001 and 2005 something ford did makes the car speed up on its OWN when the alternator starts failing. Which also causes problems with the antilock braking system since it thinks its speeding up and braking at the same time. Not good. As far as everything else....I suppose its comfortable enough. Definitely roomy. And good size trunk space.,0
Transmission has went out of 5th gear,0
Bad engineering.,0
"These cars have a nice fit and finish. They drive nice and have plenty of power.

This one has the 1.8T 4cyl. Turbo.
Once the warranty is up you need to have your own scanner and vag comm for this beast.
You'll also need good trouble shooting and mechanical skills unless you submit to the Dealer for repairs.

Seriously, going to the Dealer is like getting legally raped and robbed with today's cars.
They don't even use a gun to take your money.
It's crazy. Went to a Dealer last spring for a $100 four wheel alignment. Was told the car needed $2400 of work before it could be performed. Brought the car to a trusted local garage for inspection. Took care of the issues for less than $250.
Back to Volkswagen dealer for alignment. They said nothing about repairs.

Replaced timing belt myself along with water pump, valve cover gaskets and pcv valve, crankcase breather valve and various vacuum check valves.

The CV boots and drive shafts have been replaced several times. All four coil packs have been replaced. Had to have VW flash the ECM with the correct software.
The sunroof vents plug up causing water in the cabin and flooding the ECM under drivers floor mats and the transmission control module under the passengers.

These things cost more to keep running than what you originally pay for them.

Especially, if you like going to a dealer.

Just cleared 15 codes that came up. It turned out to be the turbo bypass valve and a clogged pcv valve. Replaced defective parts myself for under $100.

I know someone who recently had similar codes and spent North of $3000 to get the car fixed.

You have to be mechanically inclined not to get screwed on car repairs these days. These things are overly complicated for the average person to understand them.",0

"RAM 3500 diesel 4x4 (currently 135,000 miles) - Dodge did a first class effort on hosing their customers on this series of trucks.  They designed the steering linkage so that when any component requires replacement, every steering component requires replacement for an ""upgrade"" to their faulty design (the dodge death wobble).  They offered no recall or discounts on the required parts to correct their substandard design.  They also designed the power steering reservoir to leak after a few years, rather than buying a new $30.00-$40.00 reservoir they require you to buy a complete redesigned power steering pump, new mounting bracket and of course the new reservoir (parts over $800.00 without installation labor).  The best of all is that the ring gear in the front axle self destructed and destroyed the front axle housing (required new front axle housing and internal parts), again no breaks in pricing for an inferior design.  And yes the truck was serviced regularly.  I also have a 1996 Chevy K1500 4X4,  a 1999 Ford Expedition and a 2008 Ford Shelby GT500 and have never had problem like this with either of the two older vehicles or the 4 year newer vehicle.

Three mechanics tried to find where it was leaking from but couldn't determine source. Obvious suspect was the intake manifold but could never be proven. Finally had to replace the engine because it was cheaper than trying to repair it.
2. Instrument cluster has failed completely (all instruments at zero) 3 times. Suspect faulty cold soldering on the board.",0

I have a 1999 Camry with 220,000 miles, driven in the same conditions with original brake lines, HVAC/Air works perfectly, original exhaust manifold, no instrument issues.  The dome light on the Camry has issues, so I guess that is one thing the truck has going for it.  I may try a Tundra when this dog dies.",0

I have far fewer problems with my Toyota Corolla that has twice the miles.",0
It gets horrible fuel millage.,0
"As much as I hate this thing, I have to say I have been impressed with how long it has lasted. After 203,000 miles it is slowly being consumed by rust and gets a new oil leak every 5,000 miles or so, but it has otherwise been reliable and never needed much more than basic maintenance and replacement of smaller parts that shouldn't have lasted so long in the first place. It must be a Wednesday car, because these things have so many complaints of ball joints failing, and head gaskets blowing, and then there's that pesky gas tank that tends to explode in rear end collisions.

So how about maintenance? If you do your own maintenance, you WILL hate this vehicle. This is probably the biggest reason I dislike this vehicle. Recently I had the pleasure of replacing the valve cover gaskets to fix oil leaks. Seems like an easy enough job on a longitudinal mount V6. Someone took the money Chrysler saved by ridiculously mounting the window controls in the center console, and used it to buy extra-secure electrical connectors for the engine bay. Not connectors where you just push a tab and pop the connector off, oh no... They have these plastic locks that you need so slide out first. After a few tens of thousands of miles, expect to have to break every single one of these. One of these connectors broke the throttle position sensor, adding another $40 to the project. (Though I was surprised by how well it ran without a TPS.) Then they used hard lines to connect flexible breather lines. Those broke too. Another $15 to MacGyver a fix. Then the oil pressure sender started leaking. Replacing that should cost about $12, plus a 27mm deep socket if you don't have one. After putting the socket on the sender, I was not entirely surprised to find that the hard line running from the power steering pump curved right in front of the center of the socket, about 1/2"" in front of it, leaving you with no good way to attach a wrench and actually loosen the sender. How about something simpler, like an oil change? The filter is mounted on the front of the engine, near the bottom, at an angle. It is impossible to remove without getting oil all over the ground. Oh, but the engineers responsible for this engine bay of horrors put a cool little metal chute under the oil filter mount, to help make sure the oil gets spread around as much as possible. I could go on and on about this thing... The electrical system is a confusing mess, the dry traction is terrible, the wet traction is worse (I've tried multiple different kinds of tires and added sand bags to the trunk), the fuel economy is bad, the power is lacking. It does absolutely nothing well, other than starting every morning.

At this point outside of basic maintenance and wear items I have replaced:
* Rear lift gate struts
* Trunk lock
* Front passenger side window regulator and motor
* Hood struts
* Radiator (plastic end tank cracked, expected at this age)
* Oil pressure sender
* Throttle position sensor
* Valve cover gaskets
* Thermostat
* Front brake lines from the hard lines to the calipers

If you've got a mechanic with a good attitude, you may do okay with this vehicle. But I will never buy another Jeep.",0

"I have the 4 cyl AWD version of this vehicle. Saturn used a Honda CVT (Constant Velocity Transmission) automatic transmission which was designed for a car on this SUV and this has caused recurring transmission failure on this particular model. If not for that, this is actually a good car with a decent gas mileage (21-24). I've had mine fail around 70,000 miles. Good thing it was still under warranty and GM replaced the transmission. I now have 144,000 miles on it and it is still doing good.",0

I complained about a ticking noise multiple times while the truck was under warranty and was told again and again that it was ""normal"".  It wasn't.

This is the 2nd Ford truck I have owned.  It will be my last.",0
"I have the Lariat 5.4 3 valve and, although it's a beautiful truck and runs smooth but chankging spark plugs are a nightmare. If u are going to attempt it on your own, YOU WILL NEED the Lisle 65700 spark plug extractor kit to replace the. They will break, 100% guaranteed. Also, with these engines, you will most likely encounter the ""knocking/ticking"" noise (mine does that noise at 90,000 miles) and there's 1000 possibilities of what can cause it.

Again beautiful truck and if the engine is good, it becomes a great truck. However, due to the horrible design of the engine and all the defects that you are bound to encounter...i don't think it's worth it with these trucks. Go on YouTube and look up all the nightmare videos of the dreaded 5.4 v8 3 valve f@&$ing engines",0

"I'm a Ford truck guy but this truck tested my limits. This was a Supercrew FX4 and loaded but had it's issues. I sold it with less than 70K original miles and it still looked as good as the day I drove it off the lot, I took great care of this truck. The 5.4 3 valve engine always felt under powered and had it's share of problems. At 35K I had to have the cam phasers replaced, at 63K they failed again and this time I eliminated them with a kit and after that it ran great but was still under powered. Ford replaced a faulty power steering pump at 50K and it needed it replaced again when I sold it. Ford rebuilt the rear axle after it started making horrible noises at 62K and when I sold it the transmission was going out. The brakes were horrible, you had to about stand on them to stop it. I only drove this truck about 6 miles a day round trip, other than a few road trips. At the time I sold this truck it had gotten to the point we no longer trusted it enough to take it anywhere. The best fuel economy I ever got was 12 mpg, even on the interstate using the cruise control. With that kind of economy we usually drove my wife's 2010 Ford Raptor, same economy with way more power and a much better ride! I bought a 2013 F-150 Ecoboost 4X4 and love it and I regard this as the best truck I have ever owned, the 2004 ranks as the worst and I have had a lot of Ford trucks starting with a 1979 F-150 XLT 4X4.",0
The truck is very awsome for the most part.  The only thing that is very depressing is that Ford won't stand behind the cam phasers.  So just having worry about when you have to replace the engine really is a downer.,0
"It's great when it is running, but it burns a lot of gas. When you start having problems watch out $$$$$,  it's like all I do is pour money into this vehicle to get it back to running like it was, but still haven't achieved it. I have poured over $3,000 just this year to keep from having to get another car with payments, I'm fighting a losing battle I'm going back to Buick no more ford's for me",0
Triton engine has many problems,0
Too much frustration,0
I bought a new 2004 Nissan Titan LE  4x4 with the off road and big tow package. It was my dream truck turned into a nightmare. Major problems include rear axle seals and bearings. Front drive shafts vibration at 45 MPh . Nissan said that vibration was nornmal. Power steering leak which have one high pressure  line and eight low pressure return lines to replace. Major brake issues with not being property size for the weight of the truck. Delta sensor class action lawsuit with brake system. There are to many other complaints to list. Over all dealing with Nissan makes me not want to purchase anything from them ever again.,0
"Ford Escapes are extremely reliable only up to 160,000 to 185,000 miles only. After that look out, they start to fall apart causing major money repairs having to be made. It's not worth it trying to hold onto this type of vehicle, terminate the relationship earlier on so this does not happen to you.",0
We have the diesel that nothing but problems with it since the day we bought it very expensive problems,0
"I have a love/hate relationship with Nissan.
Their cars work fine the first couple of years. Then they start failing (im referring mainly to the cars after the merge renault-nissan-samsung).
The worst, the once cheap and readily available parts for Nissan are no more. Most newer models are extremely pricey and hard to replace. And more..... its almost impossible to diagnose, even for the dealer.
For example, my Nissan Primera 2004 (P12) was non working for 16 months because the dealer misidentified a rather simple issue. And made us throw a lot of money on ""patch"" solutions. After we decided to intervine, do some real diagnose (i mean, not just connecting the Consult interface... using an oscilloscope, electric lab, and using human brains) we determined the fault to be the MAF which an alternative one costed ~ USD$ 30. That's it. Dealer wanted to replace the whole accel. body, and tons of sensors (and  wanted about USD$ 6000).

The part i love is the comfortable ride, the nice interior, and how solidly built it feels.

Still, i will never get a Nissan ever again. (In fact, back in 2013 i got a BMW and it is way cheaper to mantain and to find parts for DIY)",0
"We bought this Odyssey to replace a Dodge with 300,000 plus miles on it. The Odyssey was a very high maintenance vehicle. The scheduled maintenance is very expensive due to the timing belt replacement every 90,000 miles. This is usually a $1400 dollar item at the dealer.  I called my local dealer and inquired about this procedure and they stated $850.00. I asked does it include the Honda mandated tensioner. ""No."" the water pump, ""No"". The accessory belts and fluids? ""No."" The Honda manual requires these items, hence the final $1400.00  price. But the most damning item is the poor auto transmission. Go online to the Honda Odyssey forums. 110,000 is considered a long life. Mine made 190,000 before burning up while on vacation in flat Florida. $2600 plus renting a van for a week. I would say avoid any Honda van or Pilot (same transmission) built before 2008.",0

"Mine is the 5 speed 4 cylinder 2wd extended cab. Its been a pretty good to be light duty truck. I get average 24 mpg and 28 on a road trip. Lacks in low end power, but makes up for it in your bank account. Repairs have been average for its age, like radiator, hoses, belts and thermostat. Handles nicely, however, I do recommend installing air shocks on the rear and tightening the torsion bars slightly past stock as it will wear out shocks like crazy.",0
"Let's start with the computers. This thing has two computers and they don't seem to get along. I am constantly getting warnings about things that are not really a problem. Tire pressure, key empty, etc. Then the keys don't open the door all the time. This results in manually opening the door and jumping in to start the car before the alarm goes off. I have set the system up numerous times to remember my preferences but after a while it forgets. Then there are the design issues, the gas shocks that hold up the rear door have failed but to replace the $40 part you have to remove the headliner and half the interior of the car $1500, so now I carry a stick to hold the door up. And then the battery is located under the driver's seat. Nice work VW! Oh and your service people know all about this, many have suggested getting rid of the Touareg, however no one will buy it. Some of the worse design I have ever seen in a vehicle and my first car was a '65 MGB. Oh and good luck if you have to replace a burned out brake light, even the dealership techs brake the lens housing trying to remove it.  A quick google search on any of these issues will show I am not the only person with these problems. I'm surprised there is not a class action lawsuit on this vehicle",0
"I've owned many VW's in my time, this is by far the most maintenance intensive car I have ever owned, from brake pads that have wires coming out of them, to a tiny battery that hardly starts the car (and if it even thinks about rolling over slow it floods out and needs a tow to the dealer) It has every option known to man (half of which don't work) one of the two heated seats is a no go, I will say the 4Motion makes it AMAZING in the snow (in Michigan) its better in the snow than my full size Chevy truck (4WD)... but once I get it running again (after the lower battery flood thing they tell me is normal) its going on the sale block, I owned it 4 years and have done more work on it than any other vehicle I have ever owned... It even falls behind my Chrysler that I had to put a new engine in at 150,000 miles...",0
Product didn't fit.,0
"I actually had this car for 12 years and when I traded it in, it only had 60k miles. However, pretty much from the beginning, little things started going wrong - mostly, electrical. Right off the bat, the ventilation system smelled of mold, which did get corrected. Over the years the interior started falling apart - the leather ripped, and the door upholstery came loose. All the wiring was plastic and literally deteriorated. The sunroof would open spontaneously, and all the doors, except for the driver's permanently locked (no it wasn't the child lock). When I turned it in, the transmission was pretty much shot. Will never buy another VW.",0

"Really disappointed in the reliability of the BMW.  My very first brand new car and saved up so I could purchase it with cash.  Got it new in December of 2004, and it seems every time you drive the car, it needs to go to the shop.  When there isn't a mechanical issue, it drives like a dream.  Gets fairly good gas mileage and the convertible is wonderful.  If you have an honest mechanic you will be fine.  The car only has 55,000 on it, and we are on our third set of tires.  Absolutely wears them out...Won't buy a BMW again but would buy another convertible.",0

"As a mini owner who thought he made a good purchase, I am like a dog chasing its tail. Parts are almost impossible as well as expensive. Retailers like Advance and Oreilly do not carry much inventory so one is stuck with internet purchases which is always a gamble. But I'm going to keep the car, do the work myself (most mechanics do not know minis and Haynes manual is parsimonious, very, very bad on the electrical components (thoroughly absent in cases, no test procedures and no discussion on how a component works technically and the famous line of Haynes: take it to a qualified mini mechanic!!! RightoH.)
The car is the best ride with tight steering and 38 mph.  But the sensors are madddening.  I purchased a remanufactured head on ebay and it is burning a quart of oil every 50 miles and giving 38 mph.  so the mini is currently on blocks, in pieces (once again) as I sort through the valve stem guides.  Try to buy the right valve compression tool at a commercial retailer. Forget about it.",0
"I do all my own work.  Even have bootleg copy of factory diagnostics.  Sorry I bought a mini cooper.  I have a 2005 S.  Stuff breaks including drivers door lock internals and plastic stuff interior.  Engine puked two spark plugs, stripped out threads as well.  So I pulled the head to fix it right.  Guess what!!!!!  Discovered the head cracked in several places.  Not worth fixing the head, had to buy another.  Car only has 85,000 miles on it and never hot, never out of coolant.  Not owner caused damage. Like all BMW products these days.  Junk.  Also, even with premium fuel, can't let engine rev below 3000 rpm for long periods or the engine cokes up with carbon.  So there goes the gas mileage.",0

"Have owned 2005 Malibu LT V6 since new in June of 2005. Gets great MPG for a v6 and is peppy. Unfortunately this era in GM was not the best for quality. We've had the intermediate steering shaft worked on every 10,000 miles until GM finally replaced the steering column when the car was out of warranty... at year 7.  Driver's seat now has the notorious crack in the frame making an accident unsafe for driver. The light sockets for markers, brake lights and signals were utter crap... Blowing bulbs every month and melting sockets. Head light assemblies were of poor design and could not handle the heat generated by the marker lights - they melted. Disc brakes need turning and/or rotors replaced every 20k miles. Eats car batteries every 36 months like clock work... Does not matter what brand or how expensive battery is. Had timing chain cover leak at 30k miles. Interior plastics all discolored from sun inside of third year.  Paint quality is horrible. Steering links get bent every 10-15k of easy driving. Numerous recalls.  Now after 11 years we have 91k mile on it and will run it a couple more years. At least the problems are predictable.",0

Buick replaced it...same issue. Buick replaced it again...same issue. They refused to replace it a third time and the service manager showed me notification to all service managers about this issue. Buick knew about it and admitted they should possibly do a recall but chose not to AND they would not authorize replacing it under warranty (the customer could just eat it). To this day I have to track my mileage to know when to buy gasoline. Within the first year: All kinds of plastic pieces and screws fell off. The sunglasses holder hinges actually melted. The $2000 DVD player fell off my ceiling. There was no jack. The handle on the inside of the rear hatch broke three times, I no longer replace it. The driver door handles (inside and out) broke, Buick wanted $400 to repair/replace, my body shop charged me $178. The driver door window switches to the OTHER 3 windows are shot and have been for years. Buick wants $200 per switch. NOT! Replaced transmission this year $3800. Tires are discontinued so I have to special order and pay a mint for them. There's more but I'm tired of typing and thinking about this crap! CAN YOU SAY LEMON?",0

"This truck has a great Cummings Diesel engine and that is about all that is great about it.  There are wind noises, air leaks around the doors.  There are numerous electrical problems especially related to the instrument cluster that will drain and kill the dual batteries if I forget to disconnect them.  The instrument cluster is about a thousand dollars for the part and the problem would most likely return again at some point.  The windshield wipers quit working even though all the fuses are fine.  The weird thing is that if I hold the window wash in the windshield wiper motor will run for as long as I hold the wash lever.  The paint which is blue on my truck seems to be holding up better than most of the Dodge paints.  But the truck has a very strong engine that will pull anything I need it to and this is why I selected this truck and why I keep it.  The nice thing about 2005 is it does not have any of the BluTec garbage whatsoever.",0

(The cruise control has caused the car to accelerate unexpectedly while driving--very unsafe.)  The cold start idle has always been too fast, even after many failed attempts to fix it. The check engine light is always on after many attempts to solve the problem.  The car rusts easily from the salt on the roads here.  This car has been a lemon.",0
"Compared to other vehicles of this type and vintage, the Ford Taurus of this generation is not competitive in terms of features or performance. The base engine is an antiquated pushrod V6 that in spite of 3 liters of displacement manages only 150 or so horsepower and 180 ft. lbs. of torque. There are naturally aspirated 4 cylinders that offer better performance and fuel economy.

It isn't a terrible car, and far more reliable than the previous generation with its transmission problems and odd ovoid aesthetic, but the ~$20k MSRP was unreasonable for the value the owner received. I would only recommend this car over others in its class if it is offered significantly cheaper than competing cars.

The seats do not fold down, limiting practicality. Standard equipment is lackluster, consisting of air conditioning, power locks, a cd player and few other accouterments. Handling, acceleration and braking are poor, even for this type of vehicle. It has no features that distinguish itself as a capable family car that any other four door sedan does not have. It is basic, uninspired transportation.",0

"2005 A4 Quattro 1.8t w/tiptronic transmission. I bought it used in good condition with 128,000 miles on it. It's a beautiful car, very comfortable. Everything has a quality touch that most other cars lack, and it's obvious that a lot of thought was put into making the controls and features as convenient as possible to use. It handles really well, and is great in the mud and snow with its Quattro AWD system. When a friend's one ton pickup got stuck in the mud, I towed it out with the Audi. However, mechanically it isn't so impressive. It had the infamous leaking coolant flange, broken motor mounts, broken window regulators and cables, bad sensors, broken sunroof tracks, various broken interior parts, etc. I've put a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor into repairs since I bought it nine months ago. Whenever you fix one problem, something else will break within a week or two. Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying one because if you survive the frustration, you'll spend way more money on repairs than the car is worth.",0

I have had to replace wheel.bearing twice (which shouldn't go.out at all), the power sliding door.no.longer works, I have had to replace the sliding door hinge, I have two bad 02 sensors, the radio controls do not work, my dash has more cracks in it than a parched riverbed, both front seat armrests have broken off, AC doesn't blow through all vents and the rear window seals have fallen off. On top of all of.this it goes through break pads faster than water goes through a sieve.
Would I buy another one? Not on a dare. I can't see a good reason why I should pay more for a vehicle that last no longer (at best) then other makes and still have to spend just as much (or more) in repair and maintenance costs than those other makes.
It seems.to.me.that the ""Toyotas are built better"" hype.is just that, hype; perpetuated by marketing companies to fool the consumer.",0
"High Maintenance Costs.  Frequent repairs.  Mediocre mileage and premium fuel required = high operating costs.

Cooling system is ridiculously complete and will fail without warning and cost a fortune to fit.  Lots of oil leaks require repair.

But hey, the car drives great, stop awesome, handles awesome but ohhh the costs.  My wife's Audi Q5 with almost 2x the mileage has less issues...for now.",0
The car has poor rubber through-out and has broken a lot.,0
"Right now, the transmission has failed and will be a $3k repair at least. It is immobile in my driveway. This car has been nothing but an expensive headache since day one.",0
"3500.00 to replace the transmission and radiator due to a recall not covered by nissan due to the mileage on my truck.
160.00 to replace faulty IPDM due to a recall making the truck to stall or not start.",0
"Good power, plenty of room and utility, handles well for a truck this size, but mine has been very unreliable.  In the year that I've owned it, there hasn't been a full month where a new problem didn't show up.  Both upstream o2 sensors went bad, 3 out of the 4 brake calipers needed to be worked on or replaced, two catalytic converters went bad, a VVT solenoid went bad, a down stream o2 sensor is in the process of going bad, and it still gets awful gas mileage.  I'm not sure if this is related to a problem or just how they all are.  I'm getting about 13.5 mpg around town in a smaller city that basically never has stop and go traffic.

Also be aware that two expensive problems that can occur on these cars are the timing chain guides going bad and radiator/trans cooler failure which causes mixing of the transmission fluid and engine coolant.  If this occurs and the owner is not aware, it will eventually ruin the transmission.  However, you can swap two hoses around to bypass the radiator internal trans cooler and avoid this problem with some help from internet guides on the topic.  Search for this well known issue's nickname, SMOD or Strawberry Milkshake of Death.

Overall, it's a nice car, but poor gas mileage and reliability are forcing me to sell mine.",0
3.7L has design flaws and results in premature failure. Oil starvation and piston blow by are common.  If you purchase one that has a rebuilt motor chances are (if done by a reputable machine shop) the problems were fixed.,0
"I finally traded in my minivans for a fun Jeep. On nice spring days like today I miss driving around with the sun roof open! That is the extent of the good things I can say about it. I traded it in around 98k miles (I put about 30k on it). From day 1 I had to start making repairs. The back windows would go off track and burn up the motors, the sun roof would leak which shorted out the middle console window buttons (which made my horn randomly go off), the gear shifter linkage would come off making it where the key wouldn't get released and I couldn't remove it from park, I went through three sets of multifunction (signal) switches, the AC module would get stuck on draining my battery. The engine would knock and shimmy if I put anything less than premium in it.
I think I was getting 12 mpg in town and 16 highway (with premium gas). This was worse than any minivan I've ever had! I gotta give it credit it's double what my 1970 Ford truck got.
It also came with a small dent in the back bumper but it didn't give me any trouble ;)
If I could afford a toy ""project"" car it would be perfect but as a daily driver you will be stuck in a parking lot trying to remove your key or profusely apologizing to the car in front of you/neighbors because your horn won't stop blaring. Not what I needed out of a daily driver.",0
Lots of plastic. Not easy to work on .doors have problems.  Radiator cracked on left side .I would not recommend this vehicle .,0
"- Fuse on positive battery terminal costs $20!!! Bought new one, but it blew, so I had to fix issue with insulating washer on alternator... dropped solder on blown fuse element to make fuse work instead of buying a new one.
- P420 error code... can mean anything dealing with emissions & fuel delivery. You have to replace fuel filter, then 02 sensors, then catalytic converter, then etc., It's a process of elimination. I got rid of the catalytic converter & installed headers to get rid of check engine light & error code.
- Rubber engine mounts needed replacing after 85,000 miles (highway miles, not stop and go miles)
- Had to replace rear wheel bearings due to extremely loud grinding, humming noise
- A/C compressor leaks like a sieve... $950 to replace
I have another vehicle with 303,000 miles on it w/none of these issues... not sure about other years, but stay away from any 2005 Nissan. I understand that is the year that they changed their electronic parts suppliers. Friend had an 05 Xterra... same issues, so he traded it in.",0
Engine probles,0
"Beware this model year! It was one of the model years when Nissan was using an electronic control module in the transmission that was known to fail. Cheapest estimate that I got to fix it is $2000. Not fixing it means that tha transmission randomly slips between 1st gear and 2nd gear, 2nd & 3rd, and 3rd and 4th. It also randomly will get stuck in fifth gear and you have to turn the car off to reset the transmission. If you buy it, make sure that this issue has already been resolved. Wish that I had known...",0
"It's good on gas & handles well but it seems like a bottomless maintenance pit. Over time, I've spent more on fixing the car than the price at which I bought it. Tie rods, lower control arm, sway bar bushings, new shocks, bell housing bushings, just to get it to ride without hearing a constant popping noise when going over bumps. Then after spending $800 on maintenance & buying 4 new tires for the car, the timing belt breaks. So I spend the money to fix that because I didn't want to just throw away the money I'd just spent in getting it to run smooth. Had to replace the cylinder head because valves had bent & water pump. Now the horn isn't working & the air conditioner clutch isn't engaging anymore. I originally purchased the car for $2,500. I'm not putting anymore into it, if something major comes up, I'm just going to cut my losses & take this old cow out to pasture. Meanwhile, I have to drive around with no AC after putting so much into maintaining this car.",0

"Ok so my Wife has a 2006 non turbo, it's been a decent car, handles great!! Tires and parts cheap! The down side is, it's a HEADACHE to work on!!! Brakes easy, oil changes easy... most anything outside of that OMG!! she has 160k on her engine and so far we've had to take apart the front end to replace the fan, bought 4 relay switches, temp control, new hoses, thermostat, alternator, two batteries, ecu, and the list goes on... and all this in the last 20k.  Did I mention how much of a pain it is to work on?  If you have to buy one, you'll need to be mechanically inclined or have enough money to have it fixed when it starts falling apart... and it will... fast.

Would I buy another one? Not in this lifetime!",0
"This car was comfortable and had a sufficient amount of space for passengers and items that are carried daily or even for short trips.  The interior materials were well made and durable except for the seat fabric.  The fabric would stain extremely easy and was difficult to clean.  This car was a maintenance nightmare.  $300 dollars seemed to be the magic number for average cost of repairs for me.  For DIY repairs, there is little room to do any work on the car due to the design, and excessive disassembly is required to reach common components that need repair or replaced.  I constantly had tire problems with this car that was evidenced by front end shaking and vibrations.  I had to replace the entire steering system after a power steering pump failure which cavitated resulting in the rack and pinion seals giving out. The required timing belt change costs a small fortune to have done, most shops where I am located wanted upwards of $1500 to replace it, and I finally found a small shop that replaced it for $900.  As with many other PT cruiser owners, and the final straw for me, was when I struck an object in the road that ad fallen off of a truck in front of me which triggered the check engine light followed by limp mode.  The verdict was the transmission needed to be replaced or rebuilt.  I sold it to a dealer and accepted my loss on the car.  I do not recommend this car for anyone unless you want to use it for a demolition derby.  Two stars because I really wanted to love it but constant let down was too much to bear.",0

"The design and functionality of the car was excellent, however in keeping with a long held tradition of Chrysler the build quality is very suspect.
The usual suspects are:-

  automatic gearbox failure (2.8 diesel)
  oil leaks on diesel (2.8 diesel)
  suspension
  poor handling
  low quality plastic
  plastic made to look like wood (looks tacky)

I like the truck, I just can't believe that dodge ever engineered a vehicle that has such bad steering control. I went through and replaced all the worn components and it steers horrible. Apparently you have to buy a bigger front bumper to help prevent the frame from flexing.

"We shopped for a long time before buying a used (95K miles) 06 RAM 2500 Cummins SLT automatic 4x4 crew cab.  We wanted a powerful tow vehicle for pulling a boat and trailer (around 9000 lbs).  Our best research was that the 03 - 08 series were solid, reliable trucks.  We have added 40K miles since the purchase.  Good news and bad news.  Good seats, comfortable ride, quiet inside - we have made some 12 hour trips - it's a big, heavy truck, but generally free of rattles.  Tows really well -- gets to high gear and stays there, no transmission searching.  Brakes are substantial, even when carrying a big load of rock or tiles.  But -- someone has said ""Cummins engine surrounded by junk"" - maybe overstated but it has engineering quality issues -- underneath - had to replace all but 2 u-joints, no grease fittings, and front ball joints, no grease fittings.  Some u-joints had epoxy injection rather than clip rings -- really hard to separate.  Just had to replace front wheel bearings -- unit bearing assemblies that have no adjustments for wear.  Oil and filter change is ok.  Transmission oil change requires dropping the pan - no drain plug - really dumb -- a sloppy mess.  Parking brake drum adjustment is very difficult, and, even after adjustment, the parking brake is not solid - pads are good.  Had to replace the steering box - it suddenly became hyper-sensitive.. We don't have big tires or drive off-road.. It should have lasted forever.  Body -- chrome front bumper is pitted with rust -- you would think that they could make a bumper that was durable.  Rear door wiring has failed on both sides due to poor design of wiring harness location at door pillars -- something every other vehicle we have had is done correctly. One of the roof light lens cracked and water dripped down into the interior -- you would think that the fixture would be sealed without the lens intact.. Interior -- one of the driver seat position motors failed -- plastic gear got chewed up -- very difficult to pull the seat to fix the problem -- we think the seats were designed to be assembled and installed as a unit without thought to making repairs -- plastic gear should have been metal..  Plastic grab handle on front pillar failed -- poor design allows handle to flex until it cracks and breaks..  Ignition switch has failed allowing you to pull the key out in any position.  Fuel mileage calculation is 25% above actual -- no way for us to calibrate (that we know of).  Truck had a DVD-based travel display -- had to remove unit and ship to repair station because joy stick was broken -- apparently a very common problem.
Had a Toyota truck with over 200k miles.. Couldn't pull my boat, but never had any problems.  You would think that after all the years that Dodge RAM trucks were made, quality would be high and a continuing focus.  P.S. Most issues we have had are so common that you can find blogs and repair videos on the topics.",0

"This production year, plus several years after, had several drive train issues. VCT valves would cause cams to lose oil pressure, rear baring in axle and pinon would prematurely go, transmission overdrive band would stretch, oil pump was to small for the 5.4l. Stay away from 2005 - 2009",0
"I puchased this truck with 150k miles on it.  Looked great, but has a lot of flaws in it.  Wish I had looked more into it before I purchased it.  First problem was that the automatic trans went out in it.  Had a friend rebuid it for me, but had seen a lot of these trannys come in because of a main drive clutch housing splits at the c-clip and you no longer have forward gears.  #2  The spark plugs. I think this is why the previous owner was selling it.  They break off when tdrying to remove them.  Cost me around $600 to have ford fix them, and I bought the plugs.  There is a won law suit against Ford, but because of the time and millage I had on the truck, I didn't gert anything.  Go figure!  #3  The cam phasers werer next.  Started making noise.  Luckly I can work on cars and replaced them myself.  What a joke!  #4  I wish I knew about this when I did the cam phasers.  But the oil pump is flawed on these Tritan engines.  The aluminum plat behind the pump flexes and you will lose oil pressure, which can effect the cam phasers.  I learned that I could have replaced these pump with  Mellings oil pump when I did the cam phasers. #5  The valve adjusters also start making noise, bad design.  Also when I was replacing the cam phasers, I replaced the timing chains at the same time.  When I took the front cover off, I found that one of the timing chain guides had broken in 3 places.  One of which went down to the crank timing sensor ring and chewed it up pretty badly.  Ended up replacing it.  I feel very sorry for anyone who purchased these trucks.  I think the Triton engine was used up to 2014 to 2016
I have a 2003 Ford Expedition with a 2 valve 5.4 engine.  Has 300K miles on it.  And haven't had to much to besides normal maintenance.  And it has more power than my 2005 truck. I think i'm having manifold prob;ems.  If you do your own maintenance, you will find that this engine is a pain in the ass to work on.  Half the engine sets under the cowling. I owned a chevy truck before this one, and I was able to replace all 8 plugs a 1/2 an hour.  The fordtrick and Expedition took 4 house.  I'm pretty sure my next truck will be a Toyota Tundra.",0
"The good thing about these teuck is that for the era they were well rounded. When new they got good fuel economy and were very efficient evn with a load.

The problems arise when they get some miles. The triton series engines were junk. Repairs are a nightmare for all parties involved. No matter the year just changing plugs are a pain usually resulting in issues such as broken plugs or bad threads in the cylinder heads. They also had issues with the exhaust manifolds cracking, their studs fracturing upon attempted removal. The intake manifolds are prone to failure where the cheap plastic meets the aluminum and should the engine go lean a backfire will grenade the manifold itself into a pile of plastic junk.

The transmissions are some of the smoothest out of the big 3. However should it fail they cost twice as much as their competition for repair. This is due to their overcomplicated nature.

Should your truck be a 4x4 the system is notorious for issues. Since the late 90s the hubs use a vacuum locking mechanism that will fail constantly unless replaced with an aftermarket manual design.

Overall a good truck when everything works. But beware should any problems arise.",0

"I have owned Fords for near 40 years. My F150 has the 5.4L Triton engine. Ford built several problems into this motor and did not do a recall and fix for any of them.  No more Fords for me. This is a long read. Sorry, but this truck has a lot of issues.
To start, the VCT sprockets (cam phasers) are a terrible design.  As the engine ages and oil pressure decreases the passenger side phaser is prone to fail and after repaired, will likely continue to fail due to lower pressure. I replaced them both once and it was costly. That right side phaser is at the end of the oil pathway of the engine amd starves for oil causing loud ticking and eventual failure. After the hassle and cost of the first phaser replace/repair, I locked them out and reprogrammed the ECM to bypass the phasers. I won't have to replace them again. It's quiet now and I only lost some power at the top end, but I think I gained some torque at the low end which helps when towing my rv. A hol nutha storee... google lock out ford phasers and you will find what I did...
  The spark plugs can be another big problem. They can blow right out of the heads necessitating an expensive repair. Though it hasn't happened to me I have seen it in the service department at the dealership I work at. Those spark plugs also have a heat shield spot welded to the base of the plug. That often breaks off and is difficult to remove from the cylinder head. A special tool is actually available for that very issue. For a tool to be designed just for that shows how common the problem is. Again, this hasn't happened to me yet. But I change my plugs often and do it using a long careful process a guy came up with and posted on a Ford forum. Takes me 6-8 hours to just change plugs. I can't afford to have shops fix my autos. Not paying $400 or so bucks to replace plugs! So all this work I have had to do myself. FYI, Pieces of the plugs can also break off and fall into the cylinder. Costly to remedy that also!
 Another big problem is the exhaust manifolds. especially the passenger side. They are prone to warp and leak causing a very loud ticking. And you have to be careful because the ticking sounds almost identical to that a failed phaser makes. I had both problems so I have experienced the noise. To replace the manifold a shop would charge hundreds and maybe more than a grand to replace it. There is no room, the studs often break off in the cylinder head because heat, rust and corrosion over time can weld the nuts onto the stud. The nuts are soft metal and can round over making getting a grip with a wrench/socket difficult or impossible. Keep vise grips and bandaids handy!  If you break a stud there is almost no room to get tools in there to remove them. And special tools are required that a guy like me doesn't have laying around and they can be expensive. A shop likely will pull the engine to do this repair. Not cheap! I replaced the manifold myself. I took my time, used lots of break free and busted knuckles over two and a half days to get it done. No broken studs, but I have seen it. I have large fat hands so if yours are smaller you might get it done some faster but not much. It is the hardest repair this backyard mechanic ever attempted.
 If you cannot tell whether a phaser or the manifold is causing the ticking, (which can be difficult and is common according to what I read online in several forums), do the manifold first.  I have a mechanic stethoscope and couldn't tell the difference. The ticking from the phaser and the manifold came from the front of the cylinder head where the phaser is located. I am talking to those who aren't wealthy and have to do it yourself. The manifold is 70-80 bucks and if that is your problem you only spent your time and not hundreds on a phaser. Another problem I need to mention is the timing chain tensioners. They operate using oil pressure and get oil before the phasers. If a seal fails on a tensioner, oil pressure to the phasers decreases and they starve for oil and fail. This issue I found to be common reading the forums and talking to techs at work. Now you are replacing tensioners and possibly timing chains, guides and of course those awesome Ford phasers!
Two other smaller issues that seem to be common according to the forums anyway, is failing power steering pumps and the pinion seal in the rear differential. I have replaced both.
 My truck is paid for and the Triton's rotten reputation makes it hard to sell for enough to make it worth selling. It just hit 90k miles and I have had most of these problems. I can keep fixing it for less than a bunch of car payments. I feel trapped, but poor folk often are with their older vehicles. I gave it 2 stars mainly because everything not part of the engine is good quality. And after all the work and hamburger knuckles it now runs quiet like it should. I guess some 40 years of sentiment affected my rating. Maybe no stars would be more fitting.  Ford really hurt a lot of people with that Triton motor and did nothing to help. Thus ends a long and loyal relationship of some 40 years.",0

Toyota responded with a limited recall and somehow avoided the lawsuit.  Most people just live with the problem and have to purchase large amounts of oil every month to keep the engine from locking up.  More info here:

I have had a Toyota RAV4 2006 for 6 years motor has never given me any problems but the rest of the car has just sooooo many recalls. I would never purchase another rav4 in my life.,0
"This is the only bad Toyota we've had.  I bought it used from CarMax with about 78,000 miles.  It slowly leaked transmission fluid, which I've read is common with these.  It had a V6 and had a lot of power, but the it had same size tank as a 4 cylinder model so I barely got 300 miles from a tank of gas.  My wife had the tailgate stuck open so she had to call me and I pulled out some of the plastic with pliers of the latch to get it to work.  It was from the rust belt (Illinois) and had some rust, and I think that's what caused my brake trouble lights to come on every once in a while.  When that happens your dashboard lights up like a Christmas tree (2 or 3 other trouble lights also come on) and the cruise control gets deactivated.  We sold it back to CarMax and recouped most of our money.  I suppose if we had bought it new with a 4 cylinder engine it might have worked out better for us.",0
"Looks cool and sounds awesome. Has a ton of power. BUT, too many spark plugs, tune up costs are expensive, low gas mileage, I spend a fortune on gas.",0
"I loved the styling of my truck, And to be fair I bought it used with 100k. But from the first week on little things started going wrong, a lot of sensors kept failing. Then Rear-end started whining , and then Transmission slipping, then my AC leaking. I had it a year and spent a lot keeping it running. on top of the 8 mpg my hemi was getting. it was a money pit. I traded it in which was good because it holds its value pretty well. so I hope this helps but remember this was my experience with my truck I cant speak for all. Good Luck",0
Great running truck..But likes to rust just by looking at it.,0
"Our Town and Country has had lots of issues including a rear wheel sensor that has had to be replaced twice for the same one.  We also have had to fix a leak in the AC, fix the seat belt release, the power window motor, oil leak, hood release cable, something with the door, and the back door keeps coming down on people unexpectedly.  Our leather seats have cracked - it is now 9 years old, but this all had broken within the first 5 years of it's life.  The back door was coming down on people during the warranty but the local dealer couldn't find the problem until it was out of warranty.

I would say we would not buy this type again.  We had previously had a Toyota Sienna, this one was cheaper with a lot of options and leather, but in the end we have had to put a lot more money into repairs and an extended warranty than we would have spent buying the top of the line of a Toyota.  Very disappointed in it.  We still have it, but the value has dropped to less than $4000 - We got this for about $20,000 originally so it's not worth trading it.

I do like that the seats fold in the floor, and I love the video system.  I love the dual sliding doors and ours has the captains chairs.",0
"Unser powered , poor gas millage ,needs constant repairs. timing belt snapped at 62,000 miles",0
Great features! Comfortable! It really fills your eyes! Too many mechanicall and electrical problems!... Research first! It's a beautiful girl with a terminal illness...,0
Great vehicle but the manufacturer will not fix their glitches unless they kill someone.  NOT COOL.  Odometer is stuck at 299999 & they want around $600.00 to $800.00 to fix & only Toyota can fix it.  I couldn't sell this vehicle with a faulty odometer if I wanted to.  Also everything on the car cost big bucks at the dealer to repair.  On one occasion during an inspection I was charged $31.00 just for windshield wipers.  My car was wrecked and the air bags never deployed.  Was never safe.  I'm so lucky I didn't have a worse accident.,0
Breaks down a lot.,0
"When it runs well it's fantastic - fast and responsive - but plagued with technical issues and over engineering that costs a fortune when things go wrong. From the (finally) recalled high pressure fuel pump problems, to problematic and expensive Vanos issues, carbon build-up issues with direct injection, and the most annoying oil leak around oil filter housing that would leak on exhaust and smoke you out of car. A small argument with a sidewalk curbing cost another $700+ to fix a steering wheel sensor that required almos complete renewal of steering wheel column for a tiny part, hence over engineering comment. If you have to buy one get it really cheap so that you can afford the over inflated BMW repair costs.",0
Brings a lot of problems,0
"I bought this car used, with around 80,000 miles on it. In the year and 20,000 miles I drove the car, it needed way too much maintenance for a car that was under 100,000 miles. Items I replaced during my ownership included windshield washer pump (unnecessarily difficult to reach), multiple parts in the adaptive headlight system (I never got these working correctly for more than a couple months), multiple sensors, squeaky pulleys, as well as the water pump, thermostat, and a coolant hose ($1,600 for this service) and then some, bringing the total I spent on maintenance over $2,500, even though I did most of the work myself. This is not to mention routine maintenance, such as the transmission fluid, which requires an expensive replacement of the transmission pan because the filter is integrated. On the other hand, the vehicle handled very well, and I never found myself wishing it had more power, but I constantly found myself worried about turbo issues and the hefty price tag that would come along with that type of repair. Ultimately, I ended up trading the car in for a Lexus, which drives almost as well, but has more features and has reliability in a completely different league.",0
"The good: Plenty of power and torque with the HO V8 engine.  Good for large cargo or towing. The Bad: Heated seat switch in a bad location, factory suspension is terrible and is non serviceable. Body and rear bumper started rusting with only 60k miles. Front rotors warped. I had wheel bearing and carrier bearings fail. Needed a new exhaust, and host of other small annoying problems. Glad I sold it !",0
Battled suspension and steering issues.,0
Absolutely horrible gas mileage. Hard to see out of when backing up. Cheap interior parts. Not the most comfortable seats especially rear seats. One good thing is that it goes anywhere at anytime in any conditions. It is a Jeep after all. 106k miles at present and has been fairly reliable. Only wheel bearing and oil pump changed so far. However rust is going to be an issue soon. Frame and under-body is covered in rust even though it has been very well taken care of each winter. I have never seen so much corrosion start so fast out of all the vehicles I've owned except for a Jeep Liberty I owned for 5 years. Unless you live in very harsh environment or work where you must be somewhere look elsewhere.,0
"This car drives great but I probably would not buy it again.  Here are the pros and cons for the vehicle which has about 60,000 miles on it.
Pros
1.  It drives great and is very comfortable.
2.  The traction is superb.
3.  Mine is a diesel.  It is quiet, has good towing power, and decent mileage (24 highway but only 14 when towing my 6000 lb camper).

Cons
1.  The inside seems cramped for the size of the vehicle.  At only 5' 4"" I'm small for a man.
2.  The visibility is not good.  The hood blocks too much of the road in front and the windows are small.
3.  The lighting is poor.  The headlights are dimmer than my 2004 Prius and the inside tailgate bulb was dim but produced enough heat to melt the plastic socket.  I replaced it with a nice, bright LED string.
4.  For me, reliability is a big factor.  I want the assurance that I'm not going to be left sitting somewhere.  I've already had to replace the transfer motor in the transmission (it left me sitting on the way to a vacation) and swirl valves (~$700 with labor).  I may be spoiled by my Prius which has 120,000 miles on it and I've only had to replace a wheel bearing (even the brake pads are the originals).",0
"We've owned this vehicle for several years and for the first two, the Jeep was very unreliable. It began to have an engine miss and would buck violently upon acceleration. It even stalled a couple times while driving.  We had it in to the dealer several times.  The dealer replaced cam sensor, crank sensor, all plugs and coils and a host of other things for a cost nearly $1500. The problem never completely went away until recently when I discovered an oil leak from the cam position sensor boss that dripped oil right into the cam sensor connector.  After sealing the cam sensor connector ( the leak could not be fixed without replacing the block !?) the problem seems to have gone away.  What an ordeal!

The suspension design is also lacking. There is never a feeling of confidence when driving as I feel the vehicle (mainly rear end) skips to the side over bumps. And yes we've had it aligned . Never felt these things in other SUVs we own ( Tahoe, Xterra)",0
"bought brand new in 2007, in 2012 with less than 45,000 miles the transmission failed.  Dealership had no interest in working with me (they actually turned me away when came in on flatbed) Took to transmission specialist repair shop and they said it was cooked, even the bell housing was burned, tried dealer again service wouldn't even return my calls, so bit the bullet and had a transmission shop rebuild it. Problems again with venting and shifting brought it back and was rebuilt again. Has a tendency to spit fluid all over engine compartment this is how I ""caught"" it in time this last time sitting in driveway idling and puked everywhere. On long trips it will spit fluid out which due to the location of the overflow/filler tube vents all over the right side valve cover, manifold etc. and starts burning. Dealer I take it to now the service guy says his does this too if he tops it off, he leaves it a ""little low"". This is the year the manufacturer decided to not have an dipstick in the fill/overflow tube so impossible to accurately check fluid level, color on your own.",0
"This vehicle has been an absolute disaster.  I have had the vehicle since 2007.  First of all the front cup holder broke on the way home.  Had it fixed by the dealer and one week later it came off its track.  The steering has had numerous issues.  It's had an oil leak since the warranty ended.  I've replaced the steering rack, the steering link, and both hub assemblies.  The transmission feels like it wants to die.  The vehicle goes through tires like crazy, even with regular alignments.  The back seats are horrendous to remove since they weigh about 95lbs each.  As a plus, it does hold seven people, and if you keep the speedometer set to 70-75, it gets pretty good gas mileage.  Also if you are the kind of person who likes working on their own vehicles....Stay far away.  This thing is a nightmare to change the sparkplugs on.",0
Gas  hoggggg,0
"The '07 Silverado has been a great truck...except for the active fuel management (afm) system.  This is the system that deactivates cylinders from eight to four when less horsepower is needed, such as cruising on a flat highway.  This deactivation lets oil blow by which leads to carbon build up.  The carbon build up leads to broken down valves, lifters, cams etc.  My Silverado broke down at 110000 miles.  Four months,  $6,000.00 and five shops later, which included a Chevy dealer, I finally had my pickup repaired.  A Ford dealer (haha) was finally able to repair the truck by installing an afm delete kit and installing an older style 5.3 cam.  The issue with these afm engines has been a huge cover up by GMC and has not had any coverage nationally.  There are forums online for this issue.  If you have a early version of the afm engine and the mileage is nearing 100k...beware!  You are in for some hard times with that vehicle.",0
had to put bout 1200 dollars into brake lines and brakes after 5 years and the rocker panels and cab corners and body fenders were all rotted out when the truck was 8 years old.,0
"It was made in Mexico. Finish on all wheels peeling,  steering wheel finish peeling, in inside door handle peeling, paint over top of wind shield peeled completely off, has never been wrecked but front bumper, rear bumper, front door, rear fenders had to be repainted starting at 50,000 miles, front bowtie peeled off... twice $180 replacement cost, speakers failed...$700, airbag sensor failed, fix air bag icon coming on and off again now, Waynesville Chev,. unable to locate problem, have airbag recall but parts not avail, all four door handles have broke, rear windows buttons will not raise windows, have to be done by drivers control, right front hub failed, oil sensor failed, $1400 repair bill this March. Paint failing below rear door again. Great looking. Rides great, up to 21 mpg on the road.",0
"My 07.5 is by far the worst truck I have ever had, on it's best day running empty it has only got 12 mpg. Pulling a 33' 5th wheel at 13,000 lbs from Portland OR to San Antonio TX, 7 to 8 mpg when it wasn't running at 225 degs temp and defueling all the time.
There has got to be something wrong, the only mods it has are a Bully Dog cold air intake and the Bully Dog triple GT turner with the 50 state tune. I have been running AMSOIL in all the holes, the truck only has 67,000 miles on it and I never run it into the ground, I have been driving Dodge trucks  since my first one a 1947 Dodge 3/4 ton flat head 6 to my first 1995 12 V diesel and my last really great truck was a 07 3500 Laramie 5.9 built to the hilt. Over sized inter-cooler twin turbos juiced 6'' exhaust it was running at 750 HP 1425 TQ 6 speed stick. And I got 25 to 28 mpg empty on the hwy and pulling my 43' Raptor 5th Wheel toy Hauler at 20K and 18 mpg. What do I have to do to this 6.7 to get power and mileage and running cooler down the road????",0
"This is the first year of the larger Jeep. It is a great snow plowing vehicle but spends far too much time in the garage being repaired. My 1995 Jeep Wrangler which this replaced was not as good at plowing, but far superior in repairs. It owed me nothing. As a mechanic I would tell customers ""Do not buy the first model year of anything"" I should have listened to my own advice.",0
"It's fun off road and with the top and doors off. Unfortunately the rest of the time it's subpar. It's poorly engineered in many ways and I seem to find a new design flaw every time I get in. Even at 50K it had the feel of a car with 4 times the mileage and at 80K, forget about it. Parts of the steering assembly failed hilariously early, as well as parts of the drive line. It's obvious Chrysler was scrambling for money when this was developed. That being said it can be fun in the right situations. Hopefully the new Fiat built Jeeps will be better thought out.",0
"Car has rust in several spots, bad quality .",0
If you like cheap plastic this is the truck for you everything breaks in this truck motor is ok power windows keep breaking the cable that lift and lowers them comes off track and you have to replace the whole assembly bottom line if i could do it over i would have bought a JEEP,0
"Electrical system and other items are unreliable.  Bought this vehicle new in 2007.  As soon as the warranty expired, the CD changer failed and won't play, the intermittent windshield wiper function failed, the wipers won't ""home"" and have to be manually turned off at the right time to get them to stop in the down position, the hose comes off the rear window squirter with every use and it squirts water all over the inside of the car, now and then the turn signals go crazy so when you turn off the left blinker the right one comes on and back and forth several times before they will stay off.  With 30,000 miles on it, it got the ""death wobble"" anytime over 50mph and needed new front ball joints and a new steering damper.  Basically, an unreliable piece of crap.",0
"Not reliable after 50,000 miles. This vehicle does not hold any resale value and you will get nothing as a trade in for it.
 It does have good looks and plenty of room.",0
"I like the truck, but I have had too many problems. The biggest problem has always been the brakes.  They feel terrible, especially under hard braking.  Plus, I have had a lot of electrical problems.  When the truck is running well, I really like the truck.  Just the right size for my needs.",0
Everything on this truck is junk. Wouldn't buy another gm product ever!!,0
"Always used a lot of oil. As it got older the rocker arms would start ticking but go away after a while. The truck uses an Active fuel management system AFM. Had to replace two lifters in the system, over a $3000 repair + time it took to repair. I would recommend getting the AFM delete kit or buying the Range Technology active fuel management deactivation chip before this happens to you if you own this vehicle.",0
"The vehicle has not quite lived up to the quality that I expected. I have spent thousands of dollars in repairs. There is a wheel issue where a sound is coming from the rear that has been fixed multiple times, but keeps reoccurring. It just turned 10 years old and I have just had to replace all of the door speakers. The engine sounds like it is stalling or misfiring when the ac is running. I have spent hundreds of dollars to get this corrected with no luck. This Chevy has been like a rock in that it has a tendency to simply just sit there.",0
"Fun car to drive. Especially the GT convertible. Too any problems with heat and air controls.
One control is difficult to fix and expensive if taken to a shop.",0
to many small problem with cam phasers  and four wheel drive actuators . this truck also is very hard on front end parts and tires.,0
A number of recall issues.,0
Too many problems one after another,0
I've never owned a vehicle that had so many mechanical issues.,0
"The parts used in the car do not last more than 60,000 miles. The frame is agile and delicate. The shocks, suspension components needed to be replace every 60,000 or max 100,000 miles. Flush and oil change often like 3 months, including transmission fluid then you will stay out of trouble.",0
The custom auto shade fits perfectly.,0
"Lemme just say this right out. I think this car is beautiful. It was my very first brand new car I bought. I drove it off the showroom with 3 miles on it. I didn't have a single problem till I hit around 30k miles. After that. Its been a nightmare.

At one point my dash was making this extremely wierd popping noise. Then that followed by all the lights in my dash going out. And then it would pop back on and every bad things are happenign to your car light stayed on till they went dark again within minutes. In fact the mph and rpm gauge would also stop working. Mechanically the car worked just fine. Electrically. It just went crazy. After taking my car to the dealership, where of course it magically stopped doing this after I showed them video proof of me driving and it happening. I was turned away cause they couldn't reproduce it.

Then it got worse. Transmission problem. Seems like the drive shaft was clunking when I shifted gears. Like huge clunking. When I shifted and gave it gas. Of course the ford dealership said. That was normal. My cousin bought the same exact car as me on the same day. He had 40k miles more than I did. He didn't have this problem. So.. yeah... normal.

Then cut to 7 years later. I take it in to get serviced. My dash thing happens at the dealership. Yay! Oh you bought an extended warranty? Oh you bought the 7 year warranty? Well. Guess what? That extended warranty starts the day you buy the car. Not what I was told. Was told that it would extend my warranty to out to 10 years but ok. Fine. I got screwed and lost like 3k. Whatever. How much is it to fix? wow 2k. FIne heres all my money. Cut to almost 10 years. Ive replaced my front suspension parts numerous times. Had it replaced again on the left side 4 months ago. Today it started sounding like metal hitting metal. Again. MY passenger seat which is rarely used ever. The cloth is basically falling off the seat. Stitches have rotted out. I get mail saying my extended warranty is about to expire.... (WTF?????) even though 3 years ago I told it was expired.

Ive taken the car in for hmmmm 5 air bag recalls. The car was great for the first 2 years. The rest has been a nightmare. As much as when I saw the new mustang come out and loved the body style. The price point alone and all the trouble ive had from my car. Ill probably just go with a nismo 370z for the same price.

This will be my last ford mustang I will ever own. Except if I find a well taken care of 60s model.",0
"This is worst vehicle I have ever owned reliability wise, and I have owned a bunch. I purchased it in 2013 with 54000 miles. In the ensuing 30 months, I had to replace the rear pinon seal, the fuel pump, the exhaust system, the stabilizer links, the left front wheel hub, the radiator, the timing chains, the left tie rod end, and the right front hub. When I traded it with 85000 miles, the pinion seal was leaking again, the windshield wipers failed intermittently, and the 4WD selector was acting up.
I finally came to realize that the reason the truck had relatively low mileage is that breaks down so much. You can't put miles on a broken down vehicle.
I will never again own a Nissan vehicle!",0
"Maybe 2 1/2 stars. Its Just okay. Too many quality control issues to name. Absolutely not worth what they cost. Mine only has 87,000 miles on it but has had too many mechanical issues to cover all of them here. The seats unraveled. The fenders rusted through. Worst is that I am waiting on the known issue of the radiator leaking into the tranny and destroying it. Only reason I give it any stars is that it does run like a scalded cat and goes very well in snow or off road as it is the Nismo edition. Tip of the day; get a Toyota. Three times the longevity for the same money.",0
"Excessive oil use, coolant leaks, bad water pump, terrible in snow, no way to turn off traction control.",0
burns oil 1 quart plus per 1000 miles...thats ok per the manual??? toyota will do nothing about it,0
"This vehicle has had its transmission replaced twice.  The first time was on Toyotas ""dime"".  The second time Toyota split the cost which left me with a $2700 out of pocket cost.  All of this before the care hit 68,000 miles.  There have been a variety of call backs over the years.  The home link no longer works properly.",0
I must have bought a lemon. Transmission went at 59k. Alternator and water pump went at around 75k. All o2 sensors needed replacement at 100k.,0
"This car has been quite a bit of a disappointment, especially since I had owned several Toyotas in the past and I loved those.  First, this car came with run-flat tires, and within the first three years of ownership, I had to change them twice (each time costing me about $1,000), since both times they just broke.  After that, I went with regular all season tires and have not had an issue since, with the tires.  Then, oil bursted out since one of the oil hoses broke, and it was repaired as part of Toyota recall.  After that, the transmission broke, about nine years after owning it, and that cost me about $8k.  The last of the incident I had with this car was another oil burst in the middle of a national park, and that cost me about $550 in towing, and the issue was fixe by Toyota as part of ""extended warranty"".",0
I had a 2007 Camry transmission problems watch this.,0
It is a ok vehicle for a few years but be prepared to trade it in before the engine starts knocking and the fake rubber plastic around the windows and doors begin to break into pieces and fall off. The point I'm making is the newest version of the vehicle are very nice but not my year.,0
Mileage terrible! Seat bases lean back and can't be leveled! Set of heater hoses cost almos $400 installed! Worst car I ever bought!,0

Plastic Plastic Plastic. Which might not be so bad if it lasted. Lots of bad vent fins. Side seat panels falling off. Clips for bumpers that don't hold well. Back bumper sill ripples in the sun and blocks rear door from opening unless you hold it down.....At least it drives....oh how I miss you 1976.....metal metal metal.,0
"If you want a jeep, be prepared that you won't get what you expected in the stock form. The 3.8l is under powered, the ball joints have plastic bushings that don't last past 80k miles. Tie rods and front geometry becomes a science if you lift them. Long story short, be prepared to spend about $4k to make it something you will enjoy (re-gear, lift, superchip, ball joints).",0
Fun to drive when your not fixing something. Jeep had mega issues with death wobble that no one could fix with a laundry list of other issues. Will never buy keep again.,0
"I liked many aspects of the Jeep Wrangler; small, maneuverable, and great in the woods. However, it was very weak on power and I added a K&N filter, dual exhaust, and a spacer between throttle body and intake at a cost of around $700.00. This picked up the power to a minimum acceptable level. Plastic parts in the shifting mechanism and cables wore out causing an $800.00 repair bill. A/C compressor drive went bad, being constructed as an integral part of the compressor it all had to be replaced. Another $650.00. Only had 75,000 miles when I traded for a new vehicle. I have had bad luck with Chrysler products, doubt I ever buy another.",0
More problems then I can count,0
I love this vehicle!  It has the death wobble and Chrysler refuses to fix this safety issue by issuing a safety recall!  This effects thousands of vehicle.  Look it up on YouTube.,0
"I have owned this car for about one year now, and the things that bug me the most about this car are the little things, like no dimmer on the vanity mirrors, no change holder, no place to store your sunglasses, no puddle lights on the doors, the shift lever when in drive blocks part of the radio display, tissues stored in the (way to shallow) door pockets blow out when there is a slight breeze. And there is more, But the better question would have to go to GM, Why would you do this to a high end Lucerne cxl ! Oh and it rides rough you feel every crack in the road.",0
"After 100,000 miles, issues start happening. Dash cracked in multiple places, engine ticks(lifter noise), rear end growl, mileage sucks, headlight lenses look like shit, doors leak water, front speakers cut out, etc. not happy with this one. Always been a Chevy guy but going ford next purchase.",0
"I would give it one star, but it has made it longer than what I thought it would. This are crap, everything rattles, the front end needed rebuilt at 65000 miles. Gas mileage went down nearly every tank after 50000 miles. It's just a cheap built truck from a company more worried about getting government loans to overpay executives. Go with Ford or Toyota.",0
Oil burner,0
"The active fuel management is the worst design and idea GM ever had!

"The main issue with this car is it is really hard to see the incoming traffic from the sides - whole car can hide behind the wide low sloping front beams. My husband says it is for safety in case of roll over, but how about safety in case I cannot see the incoming traffic and hit it? Had near misses couple of times.
In the 8 years we own the car, it had 3 recalls, the struts went bad, door locks went bad, and turn signals do not turn off by themselves after the turn is completed. Also, the cup holders in doors are fake - they cannot hold regular size cups.
It is still driveable, though.",0

"I drove an LTZ for 6 years with all the bells and whistles and just traded it. It was a disaster from the beginning. We bought it with 40k miles on it and had it in the shop for repair work about every other month during the first year. It needed a ton of maintenance over the years, both major and minor issues. One thing we dealt with for the life of the car was a glitch in the computer system. It would randomly give us error messages such as oil pressure low, check engine, etc when nothing was wrong. No repair shop could ever get it fixed. The middle armrests were constantly in need of repair - we had them fixed at least 5 times in 6 years. It was a very rough ride near the end but we didn't want to dump any more money into getting it fixed. The one thing I like about it though is the looks - it is a pretty vehicle! It is roomy and was good for hauling around kids and lots of gear.",0

"Typical GM product... the dash has cracked in two places and I've had to replace an emission control valve...  Otherwise, it's been relatively reliable (128k miles).  I guess based on that, I should give it a better rating... I just hate the way GM cheaps-out anywhere they can.  Wish I had bought a Ford!",0
"Garbage...GMC has a problem and they fail to acknowledge for obvious reasons. At 6 years and 72,000 miles the engine blew. I went several rounds with GMC over this with corporate and had the truck back to an authorized dealer 5 times after a brand new factory motor was installed. Once I finally got all the trouble codes off the dashboard for literally 3 days, I traded the truck in for a 2015 GMC 1500 that was on the lot. The local dealer worked with me knowing how much money I placed back into my 2008. I'm crossing my fingers I made the right decision to stick with GMC. I'd chalk this up as an isolated incident, but I come from a town of less than 15,000 residents and I know of 2 other 2008 GMC 1500's and 1, 2008 Chevy Silverado that have blown up at 72,000, 74,000 and 92,000 miles. This is way too coincidental. Two out of the 4 trucks were under 3 year warranty. Take note in 2016 GMC has reduced their drivetrain warranty....I'm sure that is coincidental too, right. If you can get over this stigma, the truck is ""great"" in all other categories of looks, function, comfort, etc.",0

I haven't replaced these yet, but the door seals have tears in them. Also, my left turn signal blinks fast due to a bad ""smart"" junction box. Ford stopped using blinker relays and instead require you to replace a $300+ part that must be programmed by a dealership before it can be installed.

Overall, this Expedition has been an ok vehicle, but most of these repairs were needed right after the warranty expired, and most of them were expensive to make.",0
Transmission horrible and despite being kept in a garage beginning to rust out. would not recommend this year of Ford explorer. I don't know why i go back and give ford vehicles a chance again every ford I have ever owned has beed horrible.,0
"Comfortable to drive. Major engine problems which cost about $4500 to repair at about 70,000 miles. Honda paid about half. Also problems with the alarm system going off at random times during the winter. I installed a relay wired to the interior ""cigarette lighter"" outlet so the horn will only work with the key turned on. The alarm still goes off sometimes, but it's just flashing lights, no horn. Rear windshield wiper motor needed to be replaced at 110,000 miles. The pin that holds the spring in the rear door latch handle should have been stainless steel. Ours rusted and the handle stuck open. Replaced the pin with a stainless steel one and it works fine now. Mediocre traction in the snow starting from a stop or going up hills in the snow, even with winter tires (2WD). The traction control cuts power to the wheels too frequently and for too long when they spin.",0
Honda Engineers are not what they used to be.  My run flat tires wore out at 25k miles.  The tires were very expensive.  Honda would not stand by their product.  It eventually became cheaper to replace the wheels instead of getting new tires.  Honda cars do not hold up over time like they used to.  Every month something is breaking.  Just last week the ignition lock broke.  I had to have a locksmith replace the ignition.  Who builds a car where the ignition completely breaks and leaves you stranded?  The lock smith I used said they all break.  These are very expensive cars to maintain.  Parts are high.  Every month another item breaks.  The car is designed to fail.,0
Loved the look of this vehicle but it was very generic when I bought I upgraded to leather seats but I have to say it is the most uncomfortable car for long drives.  yes it seats 8 if you have 4 adults and 4 6 year olds.  It has held up well but when you test drive a pilot drive on a highway and roll down the rear windows your ears will plug up and you will get an odd queezy feeling so you either have to roll up the windows or roll down the front windows this only happens over speeds of 35-40 mph.  I loved the car more before I dealt with the service department in Schertz TX.,0
Not enough parts are available for this car,0

"The trucks okay the only Problem is that the transmission went out under 40000 miles Ford didn't want to help fix the problem they wouldn't even pay half I was willing to pay  half of it but I think they should have been responsible because if they can't build a truck did the transmission last longer than 40,000 miles then I don't want that truck but I will never buy another Ford again and I've been Ford Beyer my whole life that's all I've ever owned is Ford's",0
"Im writing this to hopefully save someone from a costly mistake. I gave this vehicle 2 stars because until this happened it was a great truck. The 04-08 5.4 Triton motors have a huge problem that causes engine failure. It's called cam phasers. The motor starts off with what feels like a hesitation, like a fuel issue, as the problem worsens the engine gets to where it will almost cut of when you accelerate heavily. Ford will not recall it, and the vehicle is useless after the full blown issue shows up. Of all the research I've done it's in the 130k mile range. Every person I know (approx 5) that have these years triton motor is having the same issue at approx this mileage. Unfortunate, cost me a lot of money for something that can't be fixed. And for those that reseal and say someone told them they could fix the cam phaser issue, it will happen again. Don't say no one told you.....",0
"I purchased this vehicle used with only 74,000 miles on it.  Within the first month of owning it I had to replace ball joints, wheel bearings, sway bar.  The paint starting peeling and falling off on so many different places.  As I was driving around I noticed that other uplanders just like mine had the same paint problems.  Within a very short time of the paint chipping off, holes started.  I had a paint job done to it last fall and by early spring the paint was rusting off again.  Not happy, just traded it.  Ended up being VERY upside down in it.",0
"I purchased this vehicle with 64000 miles last august. Not using it on a daily basis I have only put 4000 miles on it in ten months.
I am an Amsoil dealer so I use a high quality oil costing me wholesale close to $9 a quart. To my surprise I checked the
oil after 4000 miles to find it down 2 quarts low. Called my local dealer and was told it was not unusual to burn a quart per
thousand miles. I inquired at what mileage do you recommend changing oil. He said 5000 so I said so if a vehicle holds
five quarts it could be empty at this recommend change. His answer was he would trade the car in. I have always heard
that Toyota made a quality product, this being my first will probable be my last.",0
"This truck was a piece of junk.  It ran well but that was about it.  I spent more time in the garage for recalls than any other vehicle I have owned.

I usually get between 150 and 200 thousand miles on a vehicle before trading it in while still in good shape.  This truck was dumped with less than 90,000 miles.

"The good. This SUV has the quietest cabin of any vehicle I've ever been in. Great for road trips.

The bad: I believe we've been through at least a 1/2 dozen recalls. We had an expensive power steering fix at 66,000 miles. An expensive AC fix at 95,000 miles. And now an expensive oil leak at 108,000 miles. Dealing with GM to get our money back on the power steering fix was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.

If you are considering purchasing this model, spring for the extended warranty.",0

"Bought this from Bavaria Motor Cars in Katterbach Germany in 2009 brand new. Very much liked the go-kart feel, the power, and the ability to park anywhere. It was also the only ultra compact car with any kind of class. Unfortunately, things started going downhill within the first 15k miles. I started to get the ""cold start death rattle"". I took it into the dealer in Nashville three times between 15k and 35k, and they said everything was fine despite my insistence the car just didn't sound right. At 70k miles, I was left in the parking lot with a 3k pound  paperweight. The timing chain tensioner had failed, failing the timing chain, failing the motor. After a lot of requests for more information over 4 months, BMW Munich declined to help with the new motor. Talking to the Nahsville BMW dealer, who I feel missed the ball, they declined to help with the motor as well. So, after shelling $5500 for a new motor, I am back up and running for hopefully another 70k miles. Please note my experience is not unique; When I finally got the motor replaced at Autohaus Grasser, I was led to believe this was a well known problem, and that the timing chain tensioner has undergone multiple revisions since being installed on my 2009 Cooper S. There was once a class-action lawsuit against BMW for this complaint as well, it appears to have failed.

Looks cute, performs well, reliability is seriously flaky.

This is not even including all of my issues with convertible panels popping off as the roof is retracted, or with the hood popping latch unhinging, or with the hood chrome trim breaking its mount points and flying off on the Autostratta. That or the antenna wearing down at the hinge, flapping the roof at any speeds over 55mph. This car had a lot of potential. The concept is absolutely classic. The execution left a lot to be desired in reliability.",0
"wife bought it new before we met. personally i think its the biggest piece of uncomfortable junk i ever driven. awful in the snow and rain, very tiny, horrible window switches and wiper switches, best thing about it is the miles per gallon. if you don't plan on ever doing any of the work to the car yourself like brake jobs, oil changes, fluid flushes ect then don't buy it. parts aren't cheap and mini dealers try scamming on the price of parts and labor. save yourself the time, effort and energy just buy a honda or toyota as your daily commuter.",0
"When I bought it 60000 miles on it and hadn't been a yr which will be June 2017 now only 66000 miles with problem after problem
And it's the cooper s turbo as of today June 1st in the shop as we speak had another leak ",0
"I bought a used Clubman despite my 'spidie senses' telling me to walk away in 2014! Cute little sports cars are all walking time bomb and money pits. IMHO! This one had no Turbo and had the timing chain done in 2012, so I was confident I covered my bases on likely problems with this model.

My wife absolutely loved it, so I brought it to a local BMW indie mechanic, and he gave me the green light. It ran great and never gave us any problems, you would have never known the chain was loose and slowly disintegrating. The only problem was leaking valve cover gasket and leaky oil pan. Since I do most of my work myself I dropped the oil pan and valve cover to install new gaskets....BOOM.....what do I see in the bottom of the oil pan, PLASTIC parts from the timing chain guides! I was lucky that I dropped that oil pan, otherwise the chain would have broken eventually and destroyed that engine. The timing chain is beyond my skill level, so it cost me $1500 at local shop I use for my Jeeps.

That was the first six months, more recently I put in a water pump because it was leaking a tiny bit, which is another weak link in these Mini's. I have put $2000 in parts and labor the first two years I have owned it, not counting a brake job, automatic transmission service etc. Since I did some of the work myself, a non-mechanical type would have easily sent $3000-3500 plus. Wife still loves it and she will keep me busy with this car......my advise, factor in 3-4 thousand in repairs the first few years on a used Mini, and find a shop with BMW knowledge. The turbo, water pump, and timing chain sytem are the main weak spots on these Mini's. It usually stems from too few oil changes and/or leaky gaskets, oil pan and valve cover.",0
"My 3 choices were a GTI, Mini Cooper and Honda Civic Si. A Camaro was eliminated early on. Since the Mini dealer was on my way to work, I popped in for a test drive. It was more as a novelty or joke to test drive one as I didn't take them seriously. After I test drove the Cooper S, I never made it to any of the other dealers. Driving the Mini was unreal. It is truly a ""drivers"" car. A few days later, I order a Cooper S. Then I heard that the JCW was coming so I cancelled my order and ordered a JCW. I didn't lose any money as the Cooper's were flying off the dealer's lot back then. I actually saw my Cooper S on the lot which was sort of funny. It sold a couple of days later.

This was my first import car. I purchased this so it is not a lease. I could have bought off the lot but I wanted to keep the price within a sane level so I custom ordered this car. I was/am borderline crazy for buying this car which was slightly over 30k after all was said and done.

The whole ordering experience was pretty interesting. I was able build my specs online and track the shipping of the car (even the cargo ship that was carrying it) all the way to when it arrived on the dealers lot. It was a seamless experience all in all and highlighted just how advanced high end import cars manufactures are compared to US auto makers. It really added excitement to the whole car buying experience.

DAILY DRIVING
It did take some getting used to the smaller car (it replaced a Jeep Wrangler). Adapting to the smaller interior wasn't that bad. Handling is awesome. The whole driving experience is on point. The ride may be a bit harsh for some but that's the tradeoff for the great handling.

INTERIOR
Badly designed interior controls. Some switches looks like dials, the garish large, waste of space central odometer, etc.

EXTERIOR
IMO If you have the JCW body kit, it makes it look less of a clown car. The doors have weak detents so they will close on you....alot. There is no real rain gutter so every time it rains, water rolls off the roof and on to you as you climb in.

YEAR 1 - 3 OWNERSHIP
Dealer covered all issues. The only hassle was going to the dealer for the repairs. This year had lots of issues with the engine; timing chain, fuel pump, warping hood scoop, leaking turbo oil line, leaking valve cover to name a few.

YEAR 3 - 7 OWNERSHIP (now at 89,000 miles)
Forget it. Parts are expensive and the hourly MINI dealership rates are outrageous. Due to the poor design, the heat from the turbo will crack the valve cover so the valve cover will need to be replaced again and again. I'm on my 3rd one! This part alone is over 350 dollars as it can only be replaced by a MINI OEM part. The labor they charge is probably as much. I do all the work myself and use aftermarket parts where I can. Otherwise, money would be flying out of my account faster than the mini can go. A lot of the parts are plastic (inside and outside the engine) so you will be constantly replacing parts. My timing chain is starting to make louder noises on cold mornings so I'm sure I'm due for that repair in a few months ($400 parts alone). This repair was already done once before.  The pattern seem to be every 40-50k miles before another round of failures. You will also be adding oil to this car (EVERY 2-3 fill ups), maybe 3/4 quart of oil.

SUMMARY
It's sad to say that this is a disposable car. It is a nice design but MINI destroyed their credibility by using parts and designs prone to failure. From this experience, I will never buy a MINI (or BMW for that matter) again. I'm kicking myself for not buying the Camaro. At least the Camaro could easily hit 100k miles with no real issues (I'm not sure this car will hit 120k miles before something major lets go - and you NEED to stay on top of this car). And if there were issues, the cost of replacement parts are well below the cost of import parts. Also, I almost forgot to mention the class action lawsuit for the timing chain. They won't even own up to an obviously defective design. My timing chain was replaced by the dealer under warrantee so they knew that it was prone to failure. There are thousands out there that had to pay out of pocket for this repair. Look it up if you're curious how MINI treats it's customers.

Skip this brand altogether. I don't recommend this car or brand to anyone.",0
"This was my dream car. Things started off pretty well-- almost no maintenance required. That being said, now that the car has more than 50K miles on it, I've run into issues. I replaced the spark plugs at 30K miles, after some rumblings and misfires. (Had the code read at a parts supply store.)

So at 55K miles, same thing happened again-- only this time it was the coils. Not a huge shocker. However, (my suspicion is) that without even looking at it, the dealer said that I was suffering from carbon build-up, and it needed to be walnut blasted. It just needed the coils changed, and the fault codes went away.

So why walnut blasting? Apparently in the S versions, there is not an oil separator (oil-catch can) that allows the ""spent"" full to be disposed of in such a way that it exits with the exhaust, or into the can... i.e. not on the mechanical parts in the engine (valves). From what I've read on Mini forums, this has to do with the fact that the oil would need to be dumped every time it fills up, usually around 3-5K miles. Since the synthetic oil it needs only has to be changed every 10K miles, this would require us Mini owners to actually service the car, or else the dealer would be servicing it every 3K miles, which they are loathe to do.

I think this was poorly designed, and I haven't gotten to the part where the timing chains are failing. Yes, there's a class-action being levied against Mini because their timing chains are loosening, and can cause the engine to seize/die if not changed.

Edit: Oh, and I didn't mention, if you live in an area that gets cold, your car might not start. Yes, that's right. I was travelling up north in Montana, and when the temperature would get below 20, the car wouldn't start. My husband and I ended up having to drive 36 hours straight once because we were afraid to turn the car off (once we had gotten it started) owing to the fact that we were surrounded by sub-20 degree temperatures.

I will not be purchasing a Mini again, even though it is my baby. My expensive, temperamental, highly-specific-as-to-who-I-can-get-it-serviced-by baby. I look forward to it dying so I can get something more universally serviceable, and whose design is not flawed.",0

"Fun to drive, but the 2009 Smart Fortwo has been an expensive-to-maintain car that is uncomfortable on any type of uneven road. Even seams on the pavement make their way through the seat and jar my spine. What about potholes, you ask? Well, when I hit a pothole, everything in the car gets shaken so badly it at times elicits a four-letter word from my saintliest of passengers. I've had the A/C repaired twice and now it's an annual event to recharge the gas prior to summer (the dealership ""can't find any signs of a leak"", but they're happy to continue to maintain it <wink>). The clear coat film has peeled away from about 80% of one panel and 10% of another, leaving a blotchy, chalky, dull red color instead of shiny red like the rest of the car (this is known problem with the clearcoat according to the blogs). The clearcoat issue can be resolved by replacing the panels (another $600 + labor). After the warranty expired 3 years ago, I've invested about $4,500 in additional maintenance over 4 years. I have a 2006 Saturn and 2007 Chrysler that I drive more often (and paid less for) that are holding up better with fewer problems. The Chrysler requires about $300 - $500 each year, and the Saturn is around $200/year for maintenance / repairs. Finally, consider that not many garages can ""really"" work on the Smart. For anything more complex than an oil change, I've had to take it back to the dealership. Good news is: the dealership looks like it's going to be profitable for a long time.

Other aspects of the design appear a bit incomplete. For instance, the rear glass panel used to access the cargo area requires one to dig under the panel or at the edge of the glass with one's fingers in order to lift it once it's released. It seems even a small ridge or a clip handle would have been a nice, convenient finishing touch. The audio input for the radio/receiver is in the glove compartment, requiring an iPhone to have an awkward array of an electrical feeds from the 12V adapter below the radio and a feed into the glove compartment for the audio.

The size makes it easy to park and also makes it easy to mistake the occupied parking space as free. I've learned to pull in only halfway to a parking space after seeing the large SUVs (the predominant species in our shopping mall parking lots) start to pull in where I am and screech their brakes when the drivers realize there's a short car there.

All in all, the Smart Fortwo is a good ""errand"" car or for short commutes to work, but overall, a disappointing experience. The upside is it's still a novelty in my area and it can still turn heads, inspire smiles, and start discussions with strangers in a parking lot.",0

"My wife and I both bought 2009 trucks. Mine is a Ford F-150 and hers WAS a 1500 Silverado both with similar accessory packages. The best option on the Chevy was a full swing open rear door. She had buyers remorse and wished she bought the F150 instead. There was no comparison. The Chevy did not ride as well, had squeaks and visible bothersome air leaks at 40 MPH+ driving speed we could not get rid of, and just felt cheaply put together in comparison. I was a GM buyer for many years, and as I am getting older, I have (maybe) one more vehicle left in future purchases and after switching to Ford, and seeing and driving in newer models, I doubt I will ever buy another GM product again. Nice not having truck payments for once in my life.",0
"The exterior look of the car and interior layout of the vehicle are great. The double movie screens and seating flexibility are nice for our family.

The interior is in bad shape. The seats stain with water, the foil has come off the drivers side door handle-cutting fingers, the floor mats curled up and will never stay in position, the foam seat covers will never stay attached and tucked behind plastic trim, the lower DVD player is broken, the upper one overheats, the sunroof is beginning to leak, we have electrical issues with doors and front screen system... After growing up with VW's in Germany, I thought this would be a solid reliable family car, but unfortunately I am stuck with a lemon that always has an issue.

"I've had this vehicle for 2 years. It's been problem after problem since I got it. Had to get the battery replaced the 1st week I got it, even though the Carfax stated that it was replaced only a month before I got it. I've had to replace the same turn signal twice. I've had to replace the heating element. I had to get the EGR valve replacer. I've replaced tons of small parts like rings, bolts, and screws. The locks NEVER work, only the driver side door unlocks. Lots of reviews I've read after I noticed say the same thing. I've had the batteries replaced in the fob, the fobs replaced, the fuse boxes have been checked. Nothing. The locks not working wouldn't be a problem if the only way to unlock the hatchback wasn't the fob or the unlock button on the door...which again, don't work about 97% of the time. What everyone's saying about the brakes is 100% true. The wheel joggles every time you brake. I didn't notice until about 3-4 months afterwards. I was told that my brake pads needed replaced even though they were replaced right before I got the truck and I haveNY even hit 20k miles on it, yet. The tires are really expensive because not many vehicles use that size tire. When I got a flat a while ago, I checked for used tires in my state. Not a single place carried that tire used. I had to buy it brand new.

I really like the size of the vehicle, all of the storage compartments hidden around the vehicle, the sound of the speaker system, the rear view camera, and the size of the gas tank. That aside, I'm definitely ready for another truck. I can't deal with this any longer. The locks are the absolute worst part. Imagine going to the grocery store, having a full cart of groceries, and not being able to open the hatchback at all... Or going to help a friend move because you have this spacious truck and not being able to open the doors or the hatchback to put anything in, forcing them to rent another truck... Or buying something huge, putting it in the truck, have the locks not work again when you get home, and then try to figure out how to get the thing out of the truck. I have countless other stories of how the locks not working ruined my life, but I don't want to make this too long.

TL;DR Not recommended.",0
"Obviously the best thing about this truck is the motor. Cummins has it figured out, other than that not much is good about it. Over all the craftsmanship feels cheap, and be ready to have the transmission rebuilt pretty soon, even when producing stock power levels. I have the automatic, ""68rfe"" for those interested, and it's absolute junk. And be prepared to repair or replace the emissions system on this year model as well.
 So overall, if you are willing to spend 6-8 thousand dollars to ensure reliability, then this is the truck for you. But I will be trading mine in for a Ford super duty in 2018.",0

"So, the Silverado is a solid truck, but GM is a horrible company.  When they know of a clear defect, they play ostrich and put their head in the sand and hope it will go away or the majority of warranty claims will expire before claimed.  It has happened twice on my truck.  First, the throttle body went bad while I was on the road at night.  I could have had a major accident, but I was lucky and made it to safety...at like 6 mph on a major highway.  It turns out almost all 2010 Silverado trucks have this issue...they even cover it if you have less than 120k miles on the truck,,what difference does that make?  Second, they know about the lifter problems on the trucks built in Spring and Summer 2010.  They even changed lifters in October of that year due to the defects.  Well suddenly my truck started knocking.  I took it to the dealer.  They tried changing the lifters but after a couple of tries they found the engine had thrown a rod...result $3500 out of pocket.  Had they informed me, I could have experienced a repair of about $1200..or they could have covered the defect.  But no, head in the sand and it worked...for them..and I was out the $3500.
So two known major defects, one could have cost me my life and the other cost me $3500.  GM has fewer recalls only because they do not care about their customers.",0
"Bought the truck certified pre-owned back in 2011 and have not been too happy with it.  It currently has 70,000 miles on it.  Here is the list of pros/cons I have noticed after driving the truck for 5 years:

Pros:
- The truck is a pretty handsome truck (in my opinion) and looks seems to have aged well.
- The crew cab trim provides plenty of space and comfort for 4-5 passengers.
- Traction control and auto-4x4 work very well
- Bose speaker system sounds pretty good

Cons:
- The LTZ ""luxury"" package is very chintzy
- The ""leather"" starting cracking a year after it was manufactured
- The MPG for the 5.3l is pretty terrible (10 in town/15 highway)
- The engine is pretty weak when pulling anything
- There has been a very noticeable lifter tick noise ever since I purchased it (I am told it is normal and nothing to worry about)
- The stereo/infotainment is terrible (Bluetooth is good for nothing but phone calls, display never shows enough information, very ugly, etc)
- The heated seats stopped working a year after purchase
- The chrome handles have peeled pretty badly and are razor sharp
- Transmission and oil coolant lines rot out quick and require replacement
- Drum brakes on rear wheels don't work well, braking is not very good
- The short box on the crew cab is extremely short
- The Z71 off road package is a joke",0
"Nice looking truck with a strong motor and plenty of room in the crew cab. Cons, very noisy on the road. The dash boards crack in these after the smallest bit of direct sunlight exposure and the mpg are not great too. I'll never buy another one because of the dashboard issue. This should be a recall by GM",0
I HAVE TWO CADILLAC CTS'S A 2008 AND A 2010.  I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH BOTH CARS.  I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER CADILLAC.  GM WAS NOT HELP AT ALL.,0
"Constant little problems with truck.  Rust under paint, water leaks in cab. Rocker panes rusted through. Exhaust leak.  Traded it in!",0
"This truck has oil leaking from every possible joint....axles,engine oil pan,transmission oil, transfer case, CV  joints etc.  This the best of American garbage I've ever owned.",0
On the positive side it's a nice looking truck on the other hand I've had problem after problem little ones and big ones. And the truck doesn't have as much power as my Nissan Titan did.,0
"If you think the Ford's can't build a football team, you should try their trucks!!! They are just as broken and disfunctional as their Detroit Lions are!!! I will never own another Ford vehicle in my life! This was my first and last after years of driving Chevy trucks. This truck has rusted so fast it's as if they used biodegradable steel. The rockers are completely rotted out. I have had so many petty problems with the 4x4 from Ford using TERRIBLE designs with the cheapest made parts. Engine sounds like it has a can of marbles in it and they say it's normal noise from the cam phasers. Just horrible all around. Buy Chevy and save yourself money and heartache.",0
Very poor quality,0
"Has needed alot more repairs than any other car I've owned. Had alot of recalls. The most annoying problem is whenever I hit the gas, the car will jerk really hard and I have no idea why. It will stop doing it anytime I take it to the shop. I am glad I got the extended warranty because of all of the repairs it's needed but now the warranty is up.",0
"I liked the look and liked the drive, but did not like the end result. At just under 60k miles, the turbo went out. I was lucky that it was covered. At 82k miles, the engine was toast! It slipped timing and allowed a piston to touch a valve. VW said they MIGHT be able to rebuild the whole side for $7k, but may need to replace the engine for $9k.
After some research, I found that these engines have a known problem with the tensioners. They can get loose and then cause a skip in timing, which is what happened here. After speaking with VW corporate, they agreed to cover the parts, but that I would still be out the ~$3k in labor. They would only cover the parts through a VW dealership/shop (makes sense and I had it serviced only there anyway).
In the end, I had to trade it in 'as-is' to the dealership. I lost thousands due to this known failure. Thanks VW!",0
"Started to show a lot of wear after just 3 years, was also under powered and the CVT was terrible.",0
"I have been driving this car for about a year now.

Pros:
Gas mileage - I fill the tank once a month.
Comfort - Long rides are not that bad, plus seat warmers and plenty of space in the car
Options - I like the upgraded JBL sound system, it doesn't sound particularly great but its better than other factory sound systems. That plus bluetooth has been awesome. Plus not having to have an aux cable means that I don't have to let friends play their music because I can say i need my phone connected if i get a call.
Great braking ability. Definitely something that is good for me, driving mostly around the beach town in which I reside, having to stop suddenly for tweakers and tourists randomly darting into the road. Oh, and being distracted by the nav system and nearly rear ending people (still haven't done it tho).

CONS:
Drives like a boat. This car is not that small, but it also kind of is? It drives so heavy like a volvo station wagon. Turns feel terrible. After I started driving this car, I realized why Prius drivers drive the way they drive. Fast-ish speeds, which seem hard for the car to get to, make the car feel like it will flip or something. Slower speeds feel fast enough.
The car has four blind spots at any corner. I got this car after not having a car for a year and a half wherein i drove a minimal amount. As a consequence, becoming comfortable in the driver's seat was made a little difficult by learning the strange dimensions of the car. It was a tough process, as illustrated by the dents at each blind spot. I mean, yes, it is partially that I am not a terrific driver, but this car did not make it easy. Also, the large blind spots behind the frame of the windshield has hidden pedestrians from my view. It's never resulted in anything and now Ive found awareness of them, I know to look there. But its frustrating.
Additionally, it has a terrible turn radius.
The center console and cup holders are pretty lame. Plus you have to buy an insert tonget a second cup holder that goes inside the center console, so it has to stay open to have drinks.
The positioning of the vents is bad and not warm enough. The heat fluctuates. Especially in the foot well. I like toasty tootsies.

I used to drive a toyota camry station wagon. It was awesome and way better. Huge, comfy, drove like a camry - easy smooth light. Had a V6 engine that lasted for 200k miles (new transmition at some point but still). Great family car, have fond memories of it because my parents bought it when I was 7. lasted me into my 20's. an old warhorse. just a lovely lovely car with quality interior. the wayback seats were pretty sketchy but a fun little trick to impress your friends. plus tons of storage. like so much. i fit a double tempurpedic mattress pad back there and could sleep comfortably on road trips. RIP, i wish my ex boyfriend never crashed you. and that toyota still made them.

Prius far inferior.",0
"Overall I like my 2010 Toyota Prius, but I will never buy another Prius. I have experienced an ongoing and frustrating problem with mice getting inside the passenger compartment for over eight years.  The last few years I have set mouse traps inside and under the Prius several times each week, from March to December each year, which has greatly reduced the problem, but it still continues and demands much of my time.  The dealer stated that there was nothing that they could do for me.  I owned a Subaru Brat pickup many years ago, with a similar problem, but these are the only two vehicles I have owned with this problem. I expect vermin on the exterior or checking out the engine compartment, but not to so easily gain access inside of the passenger compartment. Negligence by Toyota allows this ongoing issue.  I tried closing the vent to recirculating mode and installed hardware cloth over the ventilation air intake access under the hood, but neither method solved the problem. I really do not want to set mouse poison around my property, but that option appears more attractive each year.  I have tried dozens of other methods to scare the mice away, but only traps reduce the frequency of the problem. Unfortunately, my small garage is used for a workshop. Two friends who park their Prius vehicles outside have experienced the same problem, but not as frequent as my encounters. I have never heard of a Prius owner who garages their vehicle each night experience this issue, so I recommend utilizing a garage, if that is an option. The most common location for the mice is on top of the cabin air filter, then when one pulls the filter out, the nesting material drops down into the fan.  What a mess to clean up 6+ times each year.  Most manufacturers screen out all rodent entry points, but not Toyota, at least for their Prius.",0
"2010 Prius engine blew this week had it towed to dealer!
Really liked my Prius when purchased new in 2010 as of April 2016 dislike after experienced this problem.
My car is at the dealer waiting for a used engine since Toyota doesn't make new ones or rebuilt engines replacements they install a used engine from the junk yard! Cost of used engine $5,500 if it needs a new water pump another $500.
Having second thoughts of ever purchasing another Toyota Prius. Not a good experience!
I have been a very loyal Toyota buyer we own 3 Toyota's! :)",0
"I have a Jetta Sportwagen with a diesel engine that has been fraudulently advertised as a clean diesel.  After having a series of small wagons made by Mazda and Honda I am very unimpressed with German engineering.  My Sportwagen has been in the shop more than any car I have had in the past because: the radiator fan spontaneously fell apart, the windshield washer tank leaked, there have been a number of recalls, etc.  My previous cars were much more reliable.  Then there are a few design issues that irritate me, like you can't flip back the wipers when you are scraping off the frost or snow and the seat cover material is very cold in winter. I could live with most of this, but it is hard to like a car company that scams customers who try to do the right thing and pay extra to have a car that gets great mileage and pollutes less than other cars.",0
"The in and out wiring is reversed on both mirrors, and the passenger mirror is distorted to look through.",0
"Too many expensive defects to fix given we've only had the car for a few years. Had 3 out of 4 door locks fail, the MMI navigation turns on/off by itself, and only 25k miles on it!",0
Advertiser said mats would fit. They were right IF you completely trim them to fit.  Too much trouble to send back so I will keep them as they are and I will not repeat my mistake.,0
"We bought this for my wife about 6 years ago brand new.  Really liked it for a few years but we've had a lot of expensive repairs over the last 3 years.  Only a few of them were covered by the warranty and now that we've rolled over 100K that's expired.  It's to bad because the features are really nice, ours just hasn't been very economical to maintain.  I read a lot of reviews that people say they haven't had any issues so maybe our vehicle isn't representative of the brand, but we wish we had bought a Nissan or Toyota.  Would have cost more up front but probably cheaper in the long run.",0
Too expensive replacements,0
"Rough suspension, maneuvers like a tank. Worst vehicle I've owned in a long time. Gas mileage was terrible for a small car. The car did not hold its value and I ended up just getting rid of it.",0
Replace the transmission and engine mounts on 2011 Buick Enclave at 145000 miles. Nice car but too many problems.,0
"Nice suv but too many service problems at 80,000 miles.",0
"We purchased a 2011 Wrangler sport with 32000 miles on it. I have never been to the dealership for one car so many times in my life. I am just going to make a list.
1- driveline vibration at 45 mph, replace torque  converter @ 35000miles.
2- replace hard top seals due to leaks, under 40000miles.
3- broken transmission cooling line 40000 miles.
4- last but not least clogged heater core under 45000 miles.
 That was the last one before we traded it in. It was a get around car so it was never wheeled just driven. For the insane amount of money people pay for these I would expect more.",0
I like the car but other reviews cause me to question the motor and specifically the oil filter spring that cost me $500 to repair.,0
"Less than expected....bought it brand new, do take care of it...but one thing after another breaking down or recalls...even contacted Chrysler.  No would not buy another Jeep.  Will go back to suburban or tahoe.",0
"So I bought this car used at 1.5 years old with approx 20k miles on it.  Thankfully, I was able to buy it with the lifetime warranty, which I have already used plenty.

Pros:
*Hemi has a decent amount of power, and it makes driving relatively enjoyable.
*The sunroof is nice.
*Has off road capability (see below)

Cons:
*Before the 60kmi mark, it had to be towed twice already.  I'm looking forward to milking every single cent out of the warranty I purchased as I expect this thing to be in the shop for major repairs every 20k.
*Other random stuff keeps failing, such as the A/C.  And even when it's fixed, it feels anemic.  And like the windshield fluid nozzles, which apparently they decided to make the hose just short enough to put a strain on so they just snap.
*The GPS/Radio is AWFUL to the point of unusable.  The designers/coders obviously never used it themselves, or they did, and decided to play a joke on the owners and make certain things infuriating.  From inane ""features"" like not being able to control play/pause from your device, but instead must be done through the radio.  To ""extra bonus features"" like having to crank the radio from the usual volume setting of 10-ish to full blast 60 to get YouTube or most apps on your phone to play at normal volume.  Then when youtube is done playing (and it's paused), you can't turn the volume back down, you either must deafen yourself by changing it to FM (or whatever) and then turning it down, or hitting play again, turning it down, then changing the source.
*I question if this thing actually has any off-road ability, as when I parking in a shallow rut, I was unable to lock the diffs to get the thing to move.  I literally had one tire with minimal traction, and 3 tires firmly on the ground, and it just spun the one tire.  I tried all the settings around that knobby thing, following the instructions in the manual, and nothing.

In Summary, I definitely will not spend money on a Chrysler again.  I should have read the reviews and vetoed this car, but the wife wanted it, so she got it.",0
Go 0 to 60 in two weeks. It is a good car for teenagers and that it about it,0
"Nice car when it works.  But way too many issues.  It's my first American car, and probably my last.  I'm going back to Japanese made vehicles.",0
"Never had so many problems with a car, ever.  It is very nice, however in 2011 they cheaped out pretty hard on the parts they used to build the car, internal and external.  2011 was a bad year for this vehicle, yet I've heard nothing but good for the years after, and trust me, I've been in a lot of forums.  ALSO.. DO NOT USE ANYTHING BUT DEXOS 1 OIL!!!!!  TRUST ME!!!!",0
Too many issues with this car over its life cycle. Would not purchase it again.,0
Engine issues on this four cylinder.,0
It is the worst car I ve ever driven. Horrible trasmission system. Gas economy is a rip off.,0
"Brake issues, steering issues, ticking sound no one can fox coming from the engine, a/c compressor crapped out on me way too soon. It's nice looking and the stereo is great!",0
"Piece of junk. 3.7 engine gets poor power and gas mileage relative to its size. Good space/Leg room. Handles well for such a large vehicle. Stock tires were complete garbage. It required ridiculous repairs at less than 40,000 miles. One of the actuators (vaccum that opens and closes flaps to direct air) for the AC went out, making it impossible to defrost the windows; This would've cost at least $150 to get fixed if I hadn't been able to replace it myself. That I could forgive. However, I traded the piece of junk in when the TIPIM died. It is basically the computer that controls everything in the vehicle. So no power to the engine. A vehicle that new (4 years old at the time) and with such low mileage breaking down and leaving me stranded was beyond unacceptable. It also cost me over $1500 to get it fixed. This is a well known problem in Chrysler vehicles of this year range, and is so wide spread that it should have recalled (and in fact was in some of their more popular vehicles).",0
Great truck but emission control is horrible. Stay away from diesel anything!!!,0
"Hatch rusted after 1-1/2yrs, Ford replaced, rusted again.  Passenger side wheel well rusting badly just after 3 years.  Ford wouldn't stand behind it. 4 cylinder, gas mileage is terrible, downshifts hard.  On the positive side, great in snow, comfy ride, love the interior.  We have owned numerous Fords, but now they don't seem to stand behind them, never buying a Ford again.",0
"Looks good, great options and excellent 4x4 but rides like a tank, noisy and very poor gas mileage for its size.",0
Excellent on gas. Great in winter. No  major problems. I would recommend the vehicle to anyone. Very safe vehicle. Very roomy.,0
This car will not start in near freezing temps. It has also stalled out several times in cool weather while driving. No one has been able to find the problem. We have spent a lot of money trying to fix this problem to no avail. This is the 3rd Nissan I have owned and never had a problem with the others. Very disappointed with this car.,0
"Gave it a 2 only because it looks nice. Other than that the 3.5 is a gas hog I get 10.4mpg no matter how I drive.i swear my mph is wrong too. When the trucks cold and I start it, it makes a terrible racket up under passenger side dash for a few seconds. If I could do it all over again id definitely buy something else then the f150",0
Timing chain and hub issues.,0
"Not so much the car as the dealer. No help at all with a brake issue, and when and if there is a problem, big time law suit. The guys said it was a ""brake test"" but it is still happening every time I drive the car. No issues......yet. But I have the names of the guys who told me NOT TO WORRY about it. This is Gadsden Nissan, by the way.",0
"The vehicle runs well however I have had a string of annoying issues.  Both power sliding doors have broken down on me (cable snapped) and the cost was exorbitant to fix ($1800 CAD each door). The lift support for the tailgate also had one piston fail,  the replacement from Toyota was $347 CAD each.  I replaced them myself with parts off Amazon ($59USD for the pair).

The drive-train has not given me any issues, and the vehicle has been reliable enough in our Canadian weather.  Given the high maintenance costs indicated above, I am less inclined from buying another.  I wished Toyota would stand behind their vehicle on maintenance and not charge me such high costs.

GC",0
Had issues with AC making noise from day 1 (new car).  The tires have to be changed every 35 K miles.,0
"Nothing but problems, since car was purchased from a reputable Dealer!  Had the car 1 month, needed to have transaxle replaced, rotors,shocks,struts, and tires. Dealer claimed car was in good condition at  time of purchased,even though concerns were mentioned.",0
"It is easy to love this car until the time you have to fix something on it. I mean, things just don't make sense compare to the other japan's cars I have and had.  Having to take a front wheels off in order to change front light bulbs?  Also , I desperately tried to upgrade to LED headlight but they burn in one or two weeks, just because there is no enough heat dissipation behind the socket in closed compartment. After going for more and more expansive LED kits and literally ""bloody job"" of installing it several times, my love for this car turn in to hate.
  Compare to my honda and accura it is also loosing in terms of smart space management in cockpit . Suburu could be more creative in the way sits collapse, just like everyone else in 20xx year.
  Just one more problem: Like I note earlier, you have no way to change light bulbs or sparks from up-top, so front windshield could be just little farther from my face, considering uselessness of  big motor hood that gives not enough access.",0
It keeps breaking down :( especially on cold days!,0
Would not buy again.,0
"transmission shifts poorly, A/C has Freon leak, blender motor broke (damper motor that shifts between heat and cool), warped from brake rotors and van has less that 40,000 miles on it",0
"The engine failed at 50,000 miles.  And the hundred thousand mile powertrain warranty was voided because it wasn't serviced at the dealership",0
Ok SUV.. not good with the miles per gallon as KIA claims to be..,0
"Premium level - It was a great vehicle until the first oil change, when the dealer informed us that they needed to remove the engine to repair an oil leak that was caused by an improper seal at the factory.  We also had several air bag issues, a Nav unit that worked when it wanted to, power steering, water pump, HVAC, seat belt retractors, loose trim and I can't even remember what all else.  We must have a maintenance record a mile long.  It was an attractive vehicle and has a niche in the market as far as size since everything else is either full size or smaller, but quality was definitely not found in ours which is unacceptable for a vehicle that stickered for $50k.  We're just glad to get rid of it, because it literally spent as much time at the dealer as it did with my wife.  Only gets 2 stars because OnStar is extremely helpful and convenient.  But steer clear of the Enclave, because even our dealer noted that they see these types of problems with nearly every Enclave that comes in there.",0
Best Ride I've ever had. Worst acceleration I've ever owned. Many transmission issues. Intermittent hesitation when trying to accelerate. Been at dealer most it's life.,0
"The mats did not have loacations or proper locations to attach to the hooks of my 2500 Ram, Longhorn.  Mats fit pretty good, but they slide around and are warping.",0
"brakes squeal, transmission shifts hard,has very low trade in value ,wish i had never bought it when you take it in for a problem they say they can't find any thing wrong..",0
Faulty engine. Heater core malfunction. AC fan malfunction. Hard drive malfunction. Door lock malfunction. Otherwise it was a great car.,0
"This car has a major hesitation problem when you step on the gas, I would never buy another car from the dealer I used again, they most likely could have fix this issue but have soured me on this model of car. I have spent many hour behind the wheel and I know how a car should preform and this is just not up to par with normal. other issue would be placement of rear wiper control, and only one speed as well as the fact that the rear arm does not pull away from window so cleaning under it is difficult. Difficult headlights to replace, as they only last about 6 months. I have a few other issue but I need to move on....",0
The reliability was not what I hoped for. Right off the bat I started experiencing  check engine issues dealing with traction control low engine problems that keep reoccurring.  My air conditioning is dead but that's possibly die to an oil blowout possibly caused by Jiffy lube's screwing up an oil change.  Bottom line; if I could get rid of it I would.,0
"This ""death wobble"" stuff is totally unacceptable; dealer says nothing is wrong, yet it still does it regularly. Out several hundred dollars correcting the problem that shouldn't be there in the first place. Mine started it at 26,000 miles",0
Poorly built. Rattles at the drop of a dime. This was the end of the bailout trucks. Absolute garbage.,0
"This vehicle had a severe leak when it rained ,nit was returned to the dealer but no help . The vehicle was finally traded-in",0
"The main complaint I have is with the electronic sway bar connection corrosion issue which is quite common.  This is a part which is expensive to replace (over $2,000) and seems to be a common complaint on the web.  The company should recall all jeeps with electronic sway bars and fix this problem.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing the Rubicon model which comes with this feature.",0
Other than resale and cult following its rough riding has poor performance and mpg.,0
"At 50,000 miles and 3 years, the casting sand trapped in the engine block (from when it was cast in the Pentastar factory) finally broke loose and began blocking off portions of my radiator and heater core.  By the following winter, the heater core was completely plugged and the heater blows cold air only.  By that time it was completely past the 3/36 warranty and apparently block casting sand isn't covered by the powertrain warranty.  Repairs quoted at about $2700, after the $500 or so I spent to get the diagnosis.  And the radiator is now leaking on top of that.  Oh, and the steering column clockspring is shot (Amazon has the best price), but it sends a code for a bad cruise control switch (which was $45 and NOT the problem).  And get ready for the issue commonly known as ""Christmas Tree Lights"" on your dash.  And 2012s and '13s have the defective cylinder head problem, which fortunately has a service bulletin extending the warranty to 150k for that specific issue.  I've had the trouble codes a couple of times, but they always clear out before I can get to the dealer and for some reason those codes aren't stored if they're not active (misfire in cyl 2).
This'll be my last new Chrysler product.  I'll stick to I6 or V8 powered old Jeeps from now on.  When this finally dies I may swap in an LS engine just out of raw spite.
Almost 80k miles now.  So far the off-road systems are great.  It handles trails like my YJ could only dream of.",0

"Issue after issue, next vehicle will be a Toyota.",0
"Beautiful truck but has issues. At 24,000 started getting popping sound in bottom of steering wheel.  A Google search will tell you what you need to know. Basically an issue Ford refuses to admit.  I finally just gave up and live with this during the summer months which is when it happens. Now at 48,000 I noticed a slight ticking in the engine from the bottom. Haven't taken it in yet but from what I'm reading on the F150 forums I may be in for another bad time with Ford.",0
"Ecoboost sucks.  Every time it is driven in rainy conditions the left cylinder bank (3 cylinders) misfire.  Ford ""FIXED"" and it still misfires under rainy conditions.  I can't tow because of the unreliability.",0
2010 through 2013 SRX has a problem with leaking from the sun roof. This is a problem that will happen often depending on the conditions where the car is parked. My sunroof leaked and filled my back hatch up with water. It shorted out my rear door and cost thousands to fix with both repairs. Not worth the money. Buy a  Lincoln.,0
"Overall I've been rather disappointed with this vehicle.  I bought an Odyssey because our Pilot has 200,000 miles and is still going.  While the ride and overall fit and finish are good, the variable cylinder management is terrible.  Every time it goes out of eco mode on a slight incline there is a noticeable shutter on my vehicle.  We've already had the electronic rear engine mount replaced at 42,000 miles which did not actually solve the issue.  The dealer admitted there are a few other owners with this same issue, but Honda will not acknowledge this issue as a defect, so after my warranty runs out I'll be stuck with the $700 bill to replace the mount every time it fails.  Chances are that it's actually related to the torque converter, but that's not a fix they are willing to cover under the warranty because there are no ""codes"" indicating there is an issue.  I'll admit that this issue does not appear to affect every van sold, but if you're thinking about buying a pilot or Odyssey with variable cylinder management (eco mode), take it for a long test drive first, it may feel like it could even be road conditions, but if the one you're driving has this issue you'll feel vibration in the gas petal and floor boards when the eco mode light turns off when going up a slight incline at steady speeds.  If that happens don't buy!",0
a lot of issues... this van sucks. 2012,0

"I have owned a few Toyota Van's and honestly have loved two.. First was a 91 Previa with a manual.. i replaced the SADS, replaced the Clutch 3 times, and brakes and tires a bunch of times, but after 987K miles, it never leaked a drop, burned anything, and was fun to drive with the stick shift.. I would love another.. After that was rear-ended, i was on the market for another cheap van, located a 2001 Sienna XLE, it was a disaster if i am honest when i bought it, and i ended up fixing it, at the total cost of 6K for the van, all the parts, and it only had 63k miles on it.. the van lasted till 2012 when the steering rack went bad, and at 383K miles, i just didn't feel it was worth fixing.. i do miss that van as well.. I decided i would purchase a pre-owned 2012 Limited AWD sienna.. was a mistake.. I love toyota's but that might have been one of the worst vans i have ever owned. The engine was nice, smooth, maybe a little underpowered for the weight of the van, (Say's the guy driving a previa with 120hp) The transmission was annoying.. 6 speeds, but can't find which one to be in up hills on highways, upshift,downshift,upshift,downshift.. would have to take it out of automatic more and drive it in manual mode, or go insane with the constant up and down shifting.. the other major.. and i say major because frankly it's amazing that Toyota hasn't been sued for this, but the power doors.. Yes, they malfunction, no biggie, just disconnect the door harness and use it manual, right? wrong.. there is a safety release in the doors, that will automatically open them if they think something is in the way of the door.. imagine doing 75mph on the highway and having a door randomly open on you creating a vacuum sail that sends you immediately toward a concrete barrier.. than going to toyota and telling them, and having them tell you.. ""it's a known design flaw, and it will cost you 9K dollars to repair it"" DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU HAVE KIDS!!!!",0
"Multiple exhaust temp sensors, nox sensor, Def pump, Def pump heater failure. Even had diesel exhaust filter failure at 40,000 miles. Only have 45,000 miles on it now. Each failure limits speed and/or distance you can drive. This makes out of town reliability poor.",0
"car gets great gas mileage, but finding and servicing parts is a complete PIA.  simple things like fuses are nearly impossible to find.  headlights require 1/2 day of service.  this car makes it very difficult to service on your own.  Most things require special order and a trip to the dealer service department. Certainly would not recommend this car for any person who might want to do any work on their own car",0
"I have an SxT 1.4L multiairturbo. I have had 2 transmissions and so many electrical problems with it. It will run fine it seems but when the company would mess with it for a recall or something then it would have problems for a long time. I know a lot of others had problems too. Other than that it is a beautiful shaped car for a decent price, if it didn't have so many problems.",0
"I bought my car new in July of 2013 (an Aero model with the 1.4 liter engine with turbo) and it has some strong positive and negative qualities. The positive elements have been great gas mileage (a legitimate 40 mpg on the highways, 30-32 overall), a roomy interior and trunk, good acceleration, sharp looks that include the accent lighting on the dashboard at night, and a big screen for the entertainment, phone, and temperature controls. The big negative has been the CVT automatic transmission. The car often chooses the wrong gear and is slow to downshift when needed. The TCM (transmission control module) has been replaced twice under warranty, the last time as part of a recall. The original Kumho tires did not impress but I eventually replaced them with Michelin tires that were much better. The engine and transmission have a 100,000 mile warranty.

UPDATE: I continued to enjoy my Dart until it passed 101,000 miles, then the transmission died. The car gives a code for ""excess clutch wear"" and three mechanics told me I have to replace the transmission ($4,000+). The internet is full of complaints about the Dart transmissions (manual and CVT) and it appears that Dodge knew in 2012 these transmissions were losers. I have reduced the rating from 4 to 2 stars because I enjoyed the car until it died, but it should have last a lot longer. It's now an expensive paperweight.

In December of 2014, I began using the car as an Uber driver and have put more than 61,000 miles on it in roughly 15 months, working an average of 25 hours a week. To my pleasant surprise, the car has handled this workload admirably and has gone over 80,000 miles total and still has no shakes, rattles, or vibrations. If the car had come with a manual transmission and Michelin tires, it would have been outstanding.",0
"Bought my car from a dealer, used two years ago.  It's a 2013 with 18,000 miles on it.

Within a month of buying it the radio buttons were falling off in my hand, trim pieces have fallen off the car from just normal movement. Now my thermostat is bad and needs replaced which should be a $20 part.... But Mini made it so that you have to buy the whole housing at $150 or so. Then the dealer recommends you also replace the upper radiator hose so there goes another $100!

Also, oil changes are a bit more expensive, but they're supposed to last longer so I guess it evens out? Idk. Every time someone goes wrong with the car it's an easy $500 minimum fix.",0
Gross polluter.  Tons of recalls. Poor fit/finish. Fuel injection pump problems.  Fun to drive.,0
"High cost maintenance, cost of repair high",0
decent diesel MPG but uncomfortable in ride and sub-standard worksmanship in fit and finish.,0
"Noisy, bumpy, terrible on gas, drafty, cheap interior but fun to drive around town as a second car.  Not very good in the snow either because it's too light.",0

GM Frames have Rust Issues - Frame Coating Fails Having Large Amounts of Frame Rust - For a 2013 Truck with 38K mi this is VERY POOR QUALITY -,0
7 miles to a gallon.  Has problems in neighborhood shifting.  Tends to lug way down befor shifting.  Does good on freeyway. Interior very cheap and hard to clean.,0
Never will buy again.,0
"*I own the 200S. Mine's just over 77,000 miles and stuff is breaking weekly. Alternator, Oil Pressure Sensor/Switch, batteries, visor clips, fog lights - all malfunctioning one at a time. The gas mileage, thought once great, is now dismal barely above 21 mpg highway. The power it had when new is down about 40% or so. I've kept up on the maintenance since purchasing it new. It's just not a great car for the long term. $350 to change the battery? Ridiculous! This is a car I would not recommend.",0
"When it is running its a great car. Ive spent $10,000 paying for it new an spent $9,500 to keep it running an its not paid off yet and has depreciated so far under what i still owe im stuck fixing it and im stuck owning it. Who the hell puts the car battery behind the driver side bumper?",0
Nothing bit oil leaks and turbo issues under the hood that ghe dealers say they can't find or aren't bad enough to warranty.  Like the rest of the car a lot.,0
"Second most unreliable vehicle I have ever owned. As soon as the warranty expired I rid myself of this nightmare. I had the Luxury Sport package with the 325 hp V6, it was a dream to drive this car when it was working, I loved the way it handled and the engine was no slouch. While everything was under warranty, I spent a considerable amount of time dropping this car off for repairs, it also had 17 recall repairs. Here is a list of things that went wrong (not recall related), the CUE system had to be replaced in its entirety twice, not just updated but the entire touch screen and computer, a transmission module (came loose while in the mountains of North Carolina), sunroof motor, rear differential replaced, automatic air spoilers that help cool or warm the engine would malfunction on every road trip I took and cause the check engine light to come on, and here is the real kicker, I had to have the entire upper engine (valves and rings) rebuilt at 43K when 2.5 quarts of oil just disappeared. It was serviced according to the manual as I had the Cadillac Care Plan, so none of it due to negligence. My service manager at my Cadillac dealership told me it (all modern Cadillac's) was the most problematic vehicles he has ever had the displeasure of working on in his 32 years in the business, and was embarrassed by my car's performance. I have had 4 brand new GM's my first was a Venture van, it made it to 60k when the tranny stopped working, then a 2006 Silverado (never a lick of trouble in 80k miles, great vehicle), 2008 Impala, all of the electrical components stopped by 60k even the door locks and the wipers. I will never again purchase another GM. I am now a Ford man for life as every Ford I have owned has never had a single malfunction. I guess the quality of Cadillac long ago is long gone, stay away from this car!",0
There are some definite problems with this vehicle. The transmission was replaced around 35K miles as were the wheel cylinders. I have a 2012 Sentra with 45K miles and have had no issues with it. That is a major reason I bought the 2013 model. It has been a major disappointment.,0
"I have had a fair amount of issues with the truck and wish I went in a different direction.  Went through my first set of rotors at 24k miles.  Dealer pretended they might cover them to get me to bring the truck to them from another dealer.  I had brought the truck to two different mechanics and they both said to bring it back to the dealer and have them cover it under because it was ridiculous that they would have been rusted and pitted that quickly.  The pads weren't even worn and needing replacing- they offered to put the same pads back in because they were fine. I have less than 50k miles now and the rotors are looking terrible already... will find out if they pass inspection this May.  Leaf spring clip fell off- covered by Nissan.  Belt tension-er stopped working around 12k miles and the replacement is now not working since about 42k miles. My friend bought a Toyota Tacoma at the same time and he has had no issues.  I worked all the way up the chain at Nissan and they refused to budge on covering any of the brake work.  Only other annoyance is the gas mileage- it bets about 17 which is a few less than I was expecting.  My friend has a frontier that is a few years older and his truck has a digital mileage calculator, found it very suspicious that they removed that from the new models.  My family has always had Nissans but I have to say they lost a customer over something pretty stupid that they could have made right.",0
Has had a problem since new Toyota could not fix.,0
All the def problems and recalls this year were awful.,0
"It's not a good quality. The driver side looks good but, the passenger side it did not... poor manufacturing .",0
"the only good thing is, it last forever and low maintenance, but no power on 4 cylinders model. sitting position is not comfortable, everything is an option, so base model is a brand new old truck from 1980's.",0
"I traded this thing off after only about 18 months - my first and probably last toyota- they just don't live up the the hype in my opinion..... but I know some love toyotas so to each their own....... my opinion: It requires a lot  of maintenance 30 k service is expensive, needs oil changes every 5k while most cars now days use synthetic and recommend every 10k (why?) .... seats are uncomfortable, interior is cheap plastic, the paint shows every mark and scratches unbelievably easily also mine had a weird rattle from the door that couldn't be fixed in 3 tries by dealer- drove me nuts!, absolutely terrible traction in rain or snow; the ABS seems to keep brakes from working in slippery conditions, traction control cuts power on every take off (rain or snow), it has a very poor stereo, poor gas mileage  and a tiny little bed that fits next to nothing. --- it looks good but thats about it. just not worth the money in my opinion. the only good thing is that after trying to like it for 2 years and 35k miles, I was able to trade it off for only a couple thousand less than I purchased it for so Toyota does hold its value - I just can't figure out why.",0
"Base model Tacoma. Not the same quality and reliablity that older Tacoma were built with. Stay away from the models built in Mexico, there transmissions are junk.",0
"Good truck all but the ""Hemi Tick""  when the vehicle first starts up there is a loud tick noise.  The tick noise gets softer after two minutes.  I also have had to replace a wire in the driver seat for the air bags once a year( 3 years running).  The cost is about $300.00 a pop.  Same wire will send a messages to service air bag and lights up on my dash. Love the truck other than those few problems.  Does any one know how to bypass the air bag wire in the driver seat?",0
"The car is beautiful!! It is loaded with features that you can only find in way more expensive European rides. HOWEVER... my experience tells me that this car is FAR from prime time. I've owned it for almost 2 years and I've been constantly dealing with issues with this car. I've had to make at least 10 dealer visits to fix something that has gone wrong with the car. Yes it is beautiful, it is loaded and, when it runs, it does it magestically. But it has spent WAY too much time at the dealership (approx 9-10 weeks all together) to be considered a reliable ride. In my opinion Kia missed the quality mark with this one.",0
sucks on the high way if you go up hill but  very good if you are in town,0
"Engine and CVT tranny have always run hot at highway speeds despite it having both an engine and transmission cooler.  Dealership says, ""they just do that"".  Repeated trips to dealership have yet to fix it.  Regional Manager has not been much help either.  Poor product, cannot recommend.  Seems to be the norm for Chrysler products, avoid like the plague.",0
for extra $4k  get something good maybe rav4,0
"Looks good and thats about it. The bumpers are cheap plastic and its all difficult to disassemble, the cheap wheel covers rather than the actual rims aren't very nice. If you're going for looks get the v6 but if you want something fun save your money and get the v8.",0
"Beautiful car. Fun to drive. Poorly made. Has had several recalls as well as other mechanical issues. Entire shifting column replaced after vehicle shifted itself from drive to neutral as I was traveling on the interstate. Computer processor for interior controls (climate, touch screen, radio, etc) is glitchy and delayed and seems as though it is unable to handle the demands placed upon it. As of now my passenger side back window is not functional. Luckily I purchased a lifetime warranty because it looks as though I will need it.",0
"It's ok...but Honestly wish I would have stuck with the Dodge journey!!
I have 3 kids and they are doing nothing but growing!!",0
6 speed transmission is loud and rough to change gears especially from 1-2. Clutch changes where it wants to engage at. The rest of the car is nice but not fun to drive. Would get rid of it if I could.,0
"Tranny went out @85k, fit and finish ok at best. The car was very loud inside, road noise, engine noise etc. although I am very good about regular preventative maintenance this car still fell apart, mostly highway driving. Unfortunately the Nissan CVT is worse than garbage. The good thing about this car was the MPG I averaged about 35-38 mixed driving conditions.  I was a fan of Nissan before this car, not anymore, went back to Honda.",0
"Not comfortable, too compact inside as all vehicles seem to be going that route, but I absolutely hate the foot positions, and it flares up by bad ankle, none of my other cars did this. Only other car I knew that did this was a work vehicle.  It was a small prius.  The 2013 altima also is So Loud, people know when you are there, especially when a/c is on. Buttons for trunk and gas are in weird spot.
 Looks great though, with a smooth ride.
 Also, the cloth fabric is not the nice smooth kind, its the plush kind that grabs ahold of your clothing uncomfortably, and holds into hair and lint. I had to get smooth cloth seat covers. Almost forgot, a pet peeve of mine is when I have the sun visor on the side and it doesn't go over the entire way.  It's so annoying because there's that like 4 inch gap where sun gets right into my eye. I've been to the car stores to try to find a fix for this, cannot find one. I get migraines easily, ""ain't nobody got time for that"".  I wish i had a kia optima instead, i can't wait to go back to that vehicle.",0
Quality of car is so so hate the cut transmission it's loud and annoying,0
I should have never bought this first gen model but then again maybe its because I got the bottom of the barrel? No. Talking with others many others with my yr and base model had the same problems. Mechanically this thing is sound. I enjoy driving it for the most part but the fact that I have an issue with almost every tech and perk package is not acceptable and now its underwater and I'm stuck paying for things I can't use. Back up camera is wavy like a tube tv set. Bluetooth drops calls. HUB between gauges sometimes doesn't show info. You have to almost bash your finger to the touchscreen to get it to activate your selection. I will not be buying into this brand again. I have had the software reinstalled and Mopar says there is little they can do and good luck.,0
"I bought my 2014 Tralhawk new and during my 3 years of ownership I can't stand driving it anymore.
The electronics, design and features are great, probably the best in any of the cars I've ever owned.
And compared to other midsized SUV's ,it seems to be more rugged and it is a very capable off road vehicle.
But the transmission makes this car painful to drive. The transmission is completely unpredictable and you never get used to driving the car. At times the car will hesitate when accelerating onto an expressway , other times It will unexpectedly spin the front wheels from a stop and rip away like a pony car ( I have the v6, I don't how the car performs with the 4cyl engine).
Driving around town , the car never seems to know what gear it should in.
I will say that whenever I bring the car in for service and complain about the transmission, they do reset the computer and address the issue. The car will drive somewhat normal for a few months and then back to bad. I have also gotten all the updates and recalls fixed.( there were many, many recalls).
So I've come to the end of the trail with my trail hawk and will be trading it in soon( the 3 year warranty just ended)",0
"There is one single thing that I don't like about this car. It is the shifting of the 9-speed transmission.
The software has a hard time deciding when to shift between 1st & 2nd. Also there is a longer than expected delay when shifting out of neutral.
Many times I will back into a parking spot. When I shift from Drive to Reverse, there is an excessively long delay.
When coming to a stop at a signal, and the light changes before I am completely stopped, there is often a jerking shift as the transmission tries to decide between 1st or 2nd gear for accelerating.

Another problem is that I need to tow this vehicle behind my motor home (4 wheel down towing).  There is a know problem where a random wobble will happen. Jeep has issued a ""Flat  Tow wiring kit"", which is poorly designed.  it requires me to flip a switch in the console, and to install a fuse under the hood when I tow.  When done towing, this procedure is reversed.  It does fix the wobble problem.",0
"Bought the jeep at 10,000 miles and sold at 30,000. In that time the shifter broke, the window button came off, the struts clunked and exterior trim pieces began falling off.
The transmission has 9 gears and never seems to be sure it's in the correct one so it searches, revs and lags.
It wasn't the worst car I've driven but I don't ever see myself purchasing a Chrysler again.",0
Do not buy the 2.4l. Engine. It is useless. Also the mpg is poor.,0
My 2013 sonic didn't last but 3 years. In that time it blew the turbos twice and finally the engine blew.,0
Owened for 3 months and it was in the shop for 1.5 of them and left us stranded twice. It had a lot of great features and got decent mileage especially for having a v-6. Lots of storage and well built interior. It just wasn't reliable. I wanted something that I would have to work on all the time after the warranty ran out and this was not it. Traded it for a RAV4 and we are much happier,0
"Very hard shifts, RPM's Rev up when brakes applied going down hill.  Took to dealership several times and told that is all normal.  Love the look and interior.",0
Not a big fan of the ecoboost.  Over rated in a 4x4 truck,0
"I have a lot to say about this. This car was disappointing. The steering column fell apart within 2 years and was not covered under warranty. I had to pay a lot of money to fix it. It was not drive able. The on board computer is really glitchy. I had to reset my tire sensors at the dealership more then a handful of times when I got the vehicle. The on board computer keeps telling me my airbags need maintaince then turns off. The car paddle shifters will go into manual mode if accidentally hit while driving. Why have a drive and a manual setting on the gearbox if it doesn't matter and can shift in any position.
Bad gas mileage, bunch of cheap plastic parts. Radio took 3 hours to update at the dealership. GM is a terrible company that doesn't treat customers correctly either. I am very upset. I will not be keeping this car much longer I am afraid it will just fall apart one day without any warning. I will NEVER but a GM vehicle again. Liars.",0
I do not own a 2014 F-150.,0
Service is great. Am happy with all items purchased.,0
"Too many issues. Noises in engine, missing before warmed up, rear window replaced, leaking roof and now the airbag light keeps coming on.",0
"I really like these mirrors on my truck but they are not heated as listed in the description. I had my mirrors professionally installed and the technician noticed that the little icon that you usually see on a heated mirror was not there. Upon closer inspection, I don't see any sign of a heating element at all. Sure enough, despite everything connecting up perfectly, no heated mirror. I expected it would come on with the defrost button or the heater.

These are not heated mirrors as far as I can tell.
I have a 2014 F150 crew cab xlt 4x4.

I gave 2 stars because I still like they way they look.",0
"This was my 2nd Honda Ridgeline.  My 1st was a 2006 Honda Ridgeline and I loved that vehicle which is why I bought the 2014.  However, Honda's quality control and the dealerships greed have ended this love affair.  New for the 2014 Honda Ridgeline:  1)  A rear driver's door that won't shut properly, keeps bouncing back open when you try to close it like a normal door.  You have to slam the door shut.  Note:  Had 2 different dealers look at it, neither dealer resolved the issue.  2)  A left rear caliper that sticks constantly prematurely wearing out the brakes pads and ruining the rotor at 25k.  Note:  I paid extra for the extended warranty, dealership had the vehicle for a week stated it was not covered under warranty and refused to repair it unless I paid for it.  After having the car a week and I could see they never even removed the wheel from the car as the lug nuts were still covered in dust and road dirt.  Anybody can tell you the 1st time put a impact to a lug nut, that dust and dirt is gone.  If you want super poor customer service, go to Honda City in Liverpool, NY!  3)  A glove box that will not close properly.  When driving at night you can see the glove box light on inside the glovebox through the crack due to poor assembly.  Fit & Finish on the 2014 Ridgeline is horrible, warranty repair is a JOKE.  Paid extra for extended warranty and they wouldn't even replace a defected caliper!",0
"60K miles and out of warranty, the A/C Condenser develops a leak.  Turns out many other owners are having the same issue.  So much so that there is a national back order for the part.  The dealership quoted $1070 to fix and a wait of 6 to 8 weeks for the part...  Right in the heat of summer.",0
I had a LOT of issues with my GMC. from small things like water in my front lights to my differential going out. The truck was comfortable and nice looking. Service at GN dealership was great. Felt like I had a luxury truck. Some of my friends have GMCs and habe had no problems. I decided to get rid of mine.,0
"Great style and luxury features. Continuous issues with the computers that run the safety features. The frame is made of low quality steel with a special under coating. The under coating was not applied properly and had to be scraped and re-applied. Re-application was poor. Paint on the doors flaked off and the doors had to be repainted. Re-paint quality not as good as factory. Plastic door handles, rear driver side hand broke. Steering wheel extends, but this too stopped working and it is stuck in the extended position. Of course, all happened within months of warranty expiration.",0
"Before you purchase, insist the test drive include freeway speed operation. This iteration of GM vehicle SOMETIMES comes off the assembly line with what is known in the auto world as ""Chevy Shake.""  My 2014 GMC Sierra still shakes, albeit tolerably,  when operated at 73-76 mph.  I've been asking my dealer for 18 months to fix it. What finally provided the tolerable solution was when the finish on the chrome clad wheels began to blister and peel. GM replaced them under warranty.  Now the ride quality is better, but nowhere near as nice as prior generation GM pickup trucks.
The basic design of this vehicle, whether branded Chevrolet or GMC, has not changed since brought to market in 2014.
You can lean more about this by doing an internet search on ""Chevy Shake.""
Additionally, the vehicle's projector headlights leave you blind at night, unless you modify them with either HID or LED headlamps.",0
"I love the car, I love how it drives, but I would never buy this car again the car has had nothing but issues with the transmission since I purchased it and I've already had one replaced which left me on the side of the road even though I had just taken it to Nissan not that long before.  The replace transmission has lesson 7000 miles on it and it's already turning give me the same as she's the first one dead so I took it back and they tell me that it's operating at manufacturers specifications  Every time I get McCarr I wonder if I'm going to break down again because whatever ongoing issue so seems to be have not been resolved.  Overall it's a great car with lots of fun even with a four-cylinder and great MPG.  Tons of room and the seats are some of the most comfortable seats I've been.  Really wish that Nissan could get this transmission thing right!  Nissan take note you're losing buyers!",0
"Not very impressed with my 350XL with a utility body. The interior is extremely cheap, vinyl flooring paper thin. Its lacking useful pockets and storage. The center console lid is very fragile. Transmission programming is not very good, waits too long to downshift and upshifts too early. It can be avoided by shifting manually but it is an ""automatic""  While the 6.2L gas engine sounds impressive, a shorter gear ratio in the rear would be the only thing you could do to make it feel powerful, torque band is fair but the horsepower is flat if not useless regardless of RPM. The diesel option would have been a better choice. The ride is very stiff in comparison with the older GMC I got out of and the handling is limited, not confidence inspiring in the back hills of PA.",0
Wonderful car but having issues with the tdi recall and the state is denying registration,0
"Had environmental issues and Toyota would not do anything to fix the problem.  Toyota claimed it was environmental and not directly a safety issue so basically live with it.  The A/C system would smell like smelly socks or a foul odor, after researching the issue I found Toyota has been having this problem since 2007 and a current law suit against Toyota in California for the 2012 Camry for the same problem.  Mechanically Toyota has a great product but when you own a vehicle less than a year old and costs over 40,000 dollars, and every time you put the A/C on it smells like something died or your dirty socks are in the vents I could not remain an owner of this vehicle.  I bought special sprays for the evaporator and Toyota even sells a kit for this issue as changed the filter every month with a carbon one.  I found myself crawling under the vehicle to try and spray directly in the evaporator to get rid of the smell through the drain hose, very disappointing in Toyota,not to correct the issue.",0
"The Nissan Frontier as a small truck is ok. The A/C fan went out at the 5 month time frame, the dealer has it for 2 weeks to fix it, then they didn't put all the bolts back in causing leaks and fan blade rubs. I guess the biggest reason for 2 stars is lack of dealer support.",0
"AC doesn't properly evaporate moisture & condensation.  During hot months (which is most of the year in Texas) AC blows noxious mildew smell on startup, tends to dissipate as you drive but is nevertheless not what you'd expect from Toyota.  Dealership acknowledged the issue but stated there was no real solution.  Apparently there's a class action suit in California for similar issue related to Camry.  Anyway, will never buy another Toyota.",0
"This car looks good from the outside. It stops to violent when stopping withing short distances. It already broke the driver side window up and down button. The part have to come from Korea and takes months. The sunglasses compartment is failing, but it is not reported yet, since it's close. The car will go up to 4,2000 rpm. while running normal and nothing is demanding these rpm. Everything was checked and judge as normal for this model. The Brand representative told me that if I wanted a better performace, I shoud have tell the salesman and he will offer me a more expensive model.",0
Hyundai simply doesn't stand behind their vehicles.  They literally trump up reasons why not to stand behind their warranty or promises.  Don't waste your money on the hybrid; buy a standard Toyota and get the same mileage as the Hyundai hybrid all year long.,0
It is very comfortable to drive.  I used to commute and out of all the cars I drove the best in comfort.  HOWEVER with three kids still hard with carseats.  I gave up backup camera and other options i thought i didn't need and was wrong.  So i paid more for a pretty basic car.,0
Wouldn't be a bad second car but the comfort level just isn't there. Also had trouble with persistent roof leaks. About the only 2 good things I'd have to say were the new engine is powerful and I got a good value for it on a trade in.,0
"Bought the 6.0 gas engine, what a disappointment - completely under powered with poor gas mileage 8-9 miles a gallon when towing. My wife's F-150 V-6 Ecoboost drives circles around this dog of a performer. Traded it away for another Ford!

GM radio was difficult to program and manage, rarely synced with my i-phone correctly.

Quite, plush interior but the GMC dealer didn't even want it back - such pathetic product support!",0
"Love the car but it leaks everytime it rains brand new.  It is a common problem with jeeps.  It also does not get fixed by the dealer.  ""Fun"" product but very bad engineering.",0
This was my 3rd jeep and it was the least reliable by far. During my first big snowboarding trip in Utah the front drive shaft grenaded itself during use in some snowstorm driving. The dealership was great by indicating it was fully covered under the manufacturers warranty but I decided to trade it. I know drive a 2016 4Runner.,0
The middle and back mat are to big,0
"Not impressed -a lot of electrical problems , poor mileage, under powered ,dealer and GM less than helpful....",0
"This is my sixth new Acura but definitely my last as my TLX V6 is a lousy daily driver.  The 9 speed transmission is absolute garbage unless you like driving a vehicle that bangs through the gears hard enough to spill a cup of coffee. My two local dealerships must have been trained by VW as they use every excuse in the book including ""the transmission is operating as designed"" and ""we applied the latest software update so it'll smooth out over the next 1,000 miles"". One service manager told me off the record Acura made significant design changes to the 9 speed for 2016 but those with the 2015 model are stuck because Honda doesn't want to pay dealers for the warranty claims.
Car & Driver ranks the TLX #10 in it's class and JD Power ranks Acura quality lower than Buick, Chevy, and GMC.  If quality is important to you then avoid the Acura TLX at all cost.",0
"Got a great deal on the TLX end of 2015 and only bought it due to getting thousands off sticker. I did not think the 1,000 off sticker was justified for this car after driving it earlier in the year. It does have a great smooth, quiet ride. The 4cyl has more than enough power with the 8speed DCT. It is nice having the rear cross and blind spot protection and it is a great highway cruiser getting around 35 on premium gas. Do not believe the dealer that you can run 87, well yeah you can but the engine knocks. So pros: Quiet ride, very nice ride over bumps etc, sound system is great and gas mileage is good for a car this size. Cons: 2,000 miles into owning the car noticed a crease in the headliner, not just a wrinkle as I thought. The headliner was broken, how did that pass QA? Dealer had to pull windshield out to put a new one in, always great having a brand new car ripped apart. This warranted 2 trips to the dealer, because it was not assembled 100% like new when I went to pick it up and they had to order more parts. Fit and finish inside is just ok, I would expect better for the luxury brand of Honda. Touch screen for hvac is just dumb, good I have LKAS cause you need it while changing the controls. Granted I knew this and thought I would get use to it, but give me knobs back please. Now my most recent issue is the car when shifting out of drive will not go into reverse, you have to play with the trans to get it to work. Hopefully it does not leave me stuck and using their roadside on my weekend road trip. Car is going into the shop this week for the rattles from the headliner now and the trans that is acting up. Overall I want to like the car, but so far the ownership experience is not what I had expected from an Acura product.  Also don't bother calling the Acura Client relations number, they don't give a crap as they don't care to hear about their defects, instead direct you to the dealer.  So much for a company standing by their product.

Go read consumer reports and check out what they are stating about the Acura brand this year before spending your hard earned money.  So far it hasn't been ""that kind of thrill""",0
"the worst truck i ever bought by far
1- seats shake and squeak.
2- door vibrates while offroading (sand dunes and tires aired at 10PSI)
3- i had grinding noise when in 4hi.
4- overheat easily.
5- driveline shakes and vibrate.
6- stock suspension is a joke (way too soft in front)

a 1996 ford f-150 is way better.",0
"Very small cabin with very uncomfortable seats. the aluminum body is weak and there is little if any difference in gas milage, with the lighter material in the body. I ended up trading it in for  Ram truck.",0
Poor gas milage - even with non-egressive driving. Knowing this in advanced I would have opted for a Dodge Ram,0
"The truck rides great and the performance is extremely nice.  There were a few minor issues such as the tailgate needs adjusting to have the gaps correct and the F 150 front fender badges were falling off.  The biggest issue is the darn ""Trailer Disconnected"" warning message that keeps popping up on the dash when towing my Triton trailer.  The Ford dealer attempts to correct it, but they say they need information from FORD.  Ford is either unable or unwilling to provide the information required.  This concern has been present since the truck was purchased in September 2015.  It is now the end of April 2016 and I am still left holding the bag with the concern still present.  I suppose like most people I bought the truck with the trailer tow package in order to tow, and it doesn't work properly.

Update May 2017..trailer tow still malfunctions.  FORD states it works properly but refuses to give the dealership any information they request to correct the problem stating it is proprietary.  I asked them to disconnect it, but they tell me I won't then know if my trailer is disconnected.  Funny, I look out my mirror and see the trailer is behind me, but the dash flashes trailer disconnected!  This is working properly?

Solving the problem by getting a different truck.  Thanks for the concern FORD MOTOR COMPANY!",0
Not a daily driver. With the addition of the DEF if you do to much around town driving it will clog the exhaust to the point the you will be getting a valve job done. ours was done in the first 6 months. we ended up buying another vehicle to drive around town.. When I pull my trailer or go on a long trip the truck is great. it has power to pull my 28' toy hauler up. I have not found a mountain that slows the truck down. It does not get the fuel mileage I was hoping for but it is ok.,0
the seats need to be lower or adjustable to lower them in the front.  My husband doesn't like my truck cause there is no room.  He sits to high.  When you have the lights on it is hard to see the radio dash and phone dash.,0
The engine is loud when I accelerate..it sounds like a truck. I hate it.,0
"It would be lax to say that any of the current offerings in this category are outstanding especially when considering the incredibly high cost of the vehicle. It would appear that the engineers are short on ideas such as body Q's and have gone to borrowing they should have borrowed a lot more from yesterday than a blue oval and some lines. While I am keenly aware that the tech saturated audience whom the sales force are attempting to please is often ignorant of the true price they as well as the rest of us pay for the latest gimmick being tacked onto every vehicle. This vehicle as well as it's siblings are exceedingly unnecessarily bloated, most often with things that fail to serve any practicality but do add sparkle. Now my assumption is these items are the bomb for those who believe a 1 ton truck is a family car to be parked in front of your condo in chicago. And I say to you ""Go buy a Preius"" or better yet a Chevy spark it gets better mileage and doesn't have hundreds of pounds of lithium in it that will pollute thousands of miles of nature after the thing rusts away. Some of my acquaintances in Big Sky love all the accessories and I'm happy for them they drag huge trailers thousands of mile in which case amenities are nice. I'm just trying to get some work done, even the brochure will tell you that's what trucks are for. Get this crap out of my way and give me back the storage I need in the cab. And like The Ram when bad weather strikes and conditions are right the very weather that you need 4WD for will make the electronics remove it from availability. this combined with transmissions that try to go forward or reverse when the vehicle is shut off in park and doors that don't shut all the away most of the time and alarms that mysteriously go off even when the doors are open yet dealers have no fix! This leads me to grudgingly give you 2 stars I wish it could have been less. Final word of warning for you diesel owners, buy an extended warranty or sell quick if she breaks out of warranty and your not rich you get to decide between a running truck or your kids college education.",0
"This is the 2nd Avalon I have purchased new.  I was so pleased with the first 2003 that I decided to buy another new 2015 after nearly 12 years of owning the first.  I upgraded to the Limited package for the 2015.  I immediately noticed the reduced quality of the material.  The silver ring around the top of the beverage holder started pealing away within the first 6 months--turns out to be a silver foil glued to a plastic ring.  Good news is that the local dealership replaced it since I have the 24 month free maintenance deal.  Floor mats are so much cheaper and flimsy than in previous model and the plastic that covers the hardware that mounts the seats and seat belts to the floor is constantly popping off.  I also have a rattling sound from the passenger door area that is quite annoying whenever I either drive on a road that is less than perfectly smooth or when the stereo volume is high.  I have asked the dealership to correct this since I feel that a car of this supposedly high quality should not have this problem. It only rattles in the passenger door area so I asked them to check whether the speaker in the passenger door may need to be mounted more tightly.  When I picked up the car one service person told me that they took action to mitigate the rattling, another told me that they did not hear the rattling.  None-the-less it is as bad or worse than before---still less than 20K loving/mildly driven miles. For Xmas I bought an old-time cassette recorder that I intend to use to record the rattling sound and take to the dealership next week to help the guy who said he could not hear the rattling.  I also am keeping a log of the street(s) and speed(s) driven when the rattling occurs so they can drive the same route at the same speed to replicate the rattling.  The Entune stereo and Nav systems occasionally just lock up---unresponsive to touch commands---no sound---and nothing other than pulling over, turning the radio and ignition totally off and restarting unlocks it.  This has happened about 4 times at broadly spaced intervals that never occur when the repair techs have the vehicle---frustrating!  The car seems to run fine even though I really wish they had not modified the ride from the previous smooth/luxury type ride to the more sportier ride that they think attracts a younger demographic.  My fourth new Toyota vehicle ( a Celica, a Highlander, a 2003 Avalon and now this 2015 Avalon)---may be my last.",0
"I thought I was upgrading into a flagship car when I bought this thing but I couldn't have been more disappointed.  The ride is noisy and jarring, the seats are poorly padded and very uncomfortable, and overall quality and workmanship is substandard for a car with an MSRP of $40k.  I have the limited trim and while nice, it didn't take long before an annoying rattle developed with the radio on.  Toyota's solution?  Turn the radio down to the lowest possible level.  I've mitigated much of the rattling by removing the door panels and adding a ton of automotive foam, but should I really have had to?  Plus, the radio randomly reboots for no apparent reason, but without a consistent and repeatable issue the dealership won't fix it.  Another issue is that under certain conditions the engine hesitates to starts and shudders before finally running.  Toyota has no answers nor solutions.

The plus side is that if you can handle what Outkast called ""two midgets in the back seat wrastlin'"" kind of rattling when listening to music, the clarity of the stereo is great.  The engine is also very lively and though I worry it just won't start one day it's never given me problems while driving.  The interior also looks upscale.  Still, the negatives of this car definitely outweigh the positives and I look forward to trading it in and being done with Toyota for good.",0

"I'm a former Mercedes Mechanic, left due to horrible working conditions, and poor management, However. These newer cars are a harbinger of bad design and cutting corners.  They are cheap and poorly designed. Yes, they run and ride great, when new.  Mercedes is horrible for maintenance. Having lived in Germany for many years (Military brat) I know all to well of German arrogance! They have this notion that Mercedes is infallible and immune to failure. That is not the case.  These cars are a maintenance timebomb waiting to go off.  Overpriced and difficult to work on, and extremely expensive to repair. Our labor rate alone is $130 per hour (cheaper than most MB markets).  As an example: You want to pay over $600 for a ""B"" Service oil/filter change, tire rotation, brake flush, cabin air filter, and new wiper blades? Plus, almost all aspects of vehicle operation are in someway controlled by a computer or computer subsystem on what they call CAN bus system, where everything is linked electronically. How about $130p/hr to diagnose a faulty light bulb, or cigarette lighter?  Yes, lamps are controlled by the diagnostic system of the car.  Am I over-exaggerating? Maybe, maybe not, but as a mechanic, I know I will never own a Mercedes-Benz product, even if money were not an option...
These lower ""C"" Class cars are aimed at a middle income bracket that will not be able to afford to maintain them. You have been warned, If money means nothing to you then be my guest...
Why two stars vs one? Because for the first 8-12 months, you will be happy...until

"Hood sheet metal ""vibrates"" over 50 mph, the sheet metal actually ""ripples"", like it is going to come off the truck! By far the worst thing about the truck. A serious structural problem, and what makes it worse is that Chevrolet is aware of the basic design problem and lets it go on. Are they waiting for people to get killed when the hoods start coming off these trucks when on the highways? I reported it to the NHSA people. Transmission does not shift well. Transmission not matched well to the engine shift points. Like styling. Like handling. Rides a bit rough. Controls easy to operate.",0

"The trail boss 2016 has many electronic issues with everything from the steering wheel controls for trip distance, digital speedometer (really liked this), odometer, miles per gallon, and worst of all, the electronic speed control.  None worked since the dash console was completely blacked out on me after 3 months of ownership.  Obviously, covered under mfg warranty but what a PITA.  Still NOT fixed after 3 visits to GM dealership.  The hitch was not verified for 7000 lb towing, so had to have that verified to pull camping supplies (recall).  The electronic radio/media/android auto has a million glitches.  You just cannot get that thing to work.  The radio will change station like it is haunted.  On its own.  Playing music from a wired phone is a nightmare since it automatically reverts to the radio whenever it feels, usually every 2 minutes on a long trip.  Bottom line, mechanics seem intact.  All the nice electronic adds are worthless.  Cut about $10K off the price, and maybe it's a deal.",0
"Seats are to short for any drive over a couple of hours-they do not support them.  Now I just heard on the news

"Compared to my 12 year old Acura, and my 3 year old Honda, and based on the quality of the car, it is below par.  I compare it to a politician, great advertising, but does not live up to it's advertisement. Interior is cheap, Ford car mats are cheap, and look cheap, leather seats look like vinyl.  Small issues like front door is hard to close, 1500 miles, and I wish I had bought something else.",0
"Interior has been nicely upgraded compared the last model, but overall I cannot wait for my lease to end.  The navigation is overly complicated and the layout is poor.  The only purpose the upper navigation screen serves is to prop up my iPhone so I can use google maps.  Voice recognition is frustrating and useless.  Putting in an address will take at least 2 minutes vs 5 seconds with your smartphone.

The 9 speed transmission surges as you attempt to slow down and erratically shifts.  The new ""button shifter"" is not intuitive and complicates what should be an easy task.  At times, the backup camera does not turn on in reverse.

When discussed with the Acura technician during my last service (which required a differential fluid change at 13,000 miles), he simply stated that these are known issues and that  there is no resolution or software update available from Acura.  Driving this vehicle in sport mode exacerbates this transmission problem and it feels unsafe to drive.",0
"When we purchased the MDX, we loved it primarily for the very comfortable seats. But as the months went by, I felt it had some shortcomings and my wife, the primary driver, grew to hate it. After 9 months we traded for another car. This is a comfortable car for the driver but pitches the passenger around with too much body roll and front to back pitches. The 9 speed transmission is irritating as the runs through every gear even at moderate throttle. The safety features work but are heavy handed. With no hands on the wheel it ping pongs back and forth between the stripes but if I drive it with hands on straight I get a warning that steering is required. Sport mode is pointless as it just holds the transmission in a lower gear. It is all wheel drive but definitely feels like a front wheel driver as the AWD is not well balanced. However, it was absolutely dependable and had a very well designed interior. Fit and finish were almost as good as the Subaru we previously owned but certainly not as good for handling.",0
"Love the car and how the turbo diesel drives with lots of power and great fuel economy,  too bad it was a lie...... This would be 5 stars except for the scam VW pulled on the world.",0
"The 9 speed transmission is awful.  I have owned Honda automobiles for over 35 years and decided to upgrade to an Acura.  The experience has been very disappointing.  The transmission surges when slowing down or in stop and go traffic.  It is particularly disconcerting when it surges into a crosswalk as you are slowing to a stop.  When accelerating from a stop, the shifting is harsh - and we use the comfort setting to reduce the harshness.  A few other issues - the user interface in the dash is difficult to use and periodically resets.  Also, the dash is starting to chip (we have owned the car for six months).  If you want to pay $50,000 for a car that you will not feel safe in, this is the car for you.",0
"This is my wife's car. I really did  a detailed due diligence on this car. She always makes  the choice of which one to get. Every review was top notch.
So. Mazda 3 has two types of windshield wiper controls, intermittent and automatic. She has the Touring pkg. so that comes with automatic. Automatic senses rain on your widows and turns on. Hers didn't do this nor did it do it intermittently. Since we received two recalls at the same time. Made appointment to Mazda service for recall items and told them about the wipers. They checked and she had a bad rain sensor. So they ordered a replacement part. Installed it and we went done the road. (In service for 4 days) 12 hours later the sensor fell off the window. Took it back. Come to find out that Mazda HQ says you have to change the Whole windshield out for this sensor to work properly? (In service 3 days) Got her car back, with tape on it, has to stay on for a few hours, but it is back. I am just so sorry that my wife listened to me.",0

"My complaint is about the front seats they are very uncomfortable and hard. Also the drivers side will not go back far enough without having to lower in all the way down. Just not enough leg room in the front on both sides. Also the head rest are only adjustable up or down not forward or back, they push your head forward to much. Other manufactures have fixed this by allowing you to slide them back a little. Would hate to take a long trip in this vehicle because of this. Other than the seats and leg room i like the vehicle fine.",0

"As a previous owner of a Nissan Altima I decided to make the 'big switch' to a domestic car manufacturer. The Ford Fusion is only the second US-brand car I have ever owned, the first being a 1967 Chevy Malibu. After that it was Honda, Toyota, then Nissan for years. I was a bit hesitant to go 'Ford', but after a few test drives with a equivalent Nissan Altima and a Toyota Camry I decided on a Fusion SE. The deciding factors were comfort, choice if options, and most of all availability and price.
And since the price difference was several thousands of dollars, I fell for a nicely equipped Ford Fusion SE. After about 12,000 miles I still look forward to driving it.
I should also point out that the 'treatment' from the sales personnel at the other dealerships had not been a 'pleasant' experience. And that was another factor that made me switch. I like this car! It looks great, has good acceleration and just 'feels good'!",0
"I liked this car when I bought it.  I traded in a 2012 Ford Fusion Hybrid and upgraded to the Energi to specifically get HOV stickers in California. My commute is about 110 miles round trip. The fit and finish of the car is really nice. Styling is great. They, like many other have stolen the front end design of the newer Aston Martins. All good things.

My problem with the car became evident the first time I got a flat tire. Thought it would be no big deal. Pop the trunk and toss the spare on. NO SPARE. This car comes with a mini air compressor and a built-in container of tire sealant. The main issue with this is that you can't seal any damage to the sidewall of the tires. The two times in the last 4 months that I got a flat were sidewall issues caused by road debris.

The kicker for me was a flat in Yosemite National Park two weeks ago. A rock rolled off a hillside and I couldn't safely avoid it. This flat left me stranded in the park. The saving grace was that Ford Roadside Assistance will tow you to the nearest Ford dealer, if you have no spare. I waited 3 hours for the tow truck to tow me 2.5 hours to a Ford dealership that was closed for the weekend. I could have gotten a hotel for two nights, missed work Monday, and wasted the weekend. Instead I used the tire sealant to get enough air into the tires to get me to the local Walmart that was still open. Stopped twice to air up the tire on the way.

Turns out that Ford no longer puts spares in many of their cars. That little container of tire sealant also has to be replaced by the dealership in their service department. I have to take time off of work to take the little compressor into the dealership. What a hassle.

The idea that the engineers/designers eliminated the spare to save space/money/etc is not surprising. It is unfortunate. I won't be buying another Ford before thoroughly checking for the spare tire.",0
"After 4000 miles in 7 months I can't stand this car. It is slower than I could ever imagine. If I want to pass someone on a highway going from 60 to 75 takes forever. It is also scary slow pulling on to a highway. I have never been rear ended in 30 years of driving but it may happen with this car. There are some nice features for the money but with 175 ""fake"" horsepower it stays in my driveway 5 days a week. The navigation is also annoying with how it works, all other GPS units are easy buy this will get you lost and cause you to stare at the screen to figure out where you should be going. I call it FAKE horsepower because I have owned vehicles with less power on paper that would leave this Fusion in the dust. I only use it for short trips where I don't exceed 45 mph. It's also great in bumper to bumper traffic because there is no room for acceleration. My final thoughts are if it was about gas mileage I would expect it to be slow but my average is about 20 MPG. It appears the Ford is adding a 325 HP Ecoboost engine for 2017 so that may help. I'm a strong believer that power can get you out of trouble and avoid accidents rather than getting stuck with no place to go but crash.",0
7K miles and been in the shop 8 times.  Vibration at 75mph that can not be fixed or they refuse to reengineer it.  Great service people but substandard product for the price.  Resale prices are lower than they talk about.  Don't be fooled.,0
"Owned 2013 85S for almost 3 years and 30K miles. Leather started chipping in about 6 months. Had to pay $1000 for center console since otherwise there is nowhere to store things. No pocket in doors either. Many repairs - under warranty, but what would one do when it expires? Motor whine (entire module replaced). Glove box won't open (replaced). Sunroof leak (seals replaced). Navigation does not start without cell coverage (try getting out of Seattle Lighthouse park).

Software was pretty buggy, sometime updates break existing functionality. Door handles sometimes pop and sometimes don't. Voice recognition only understand clear US English I suppose since it never understood me (BMW for example, works fine). Constantly changing and 'improving' user interface appearance. Can't refuse software updates even if you don't like changes. Ex: car started popping up 'route suggestions' every morning. I never took that road and the only way to got rid of them (according to service) was to switch or traffic based navigation completely or remove 'Work' location. If media system didn't find album cover for the title being played from USB it displayed random images, sometime very disturbing (ex: blood and gore cover of some Slipknot album - excellent choice for children in the car). Too numerous to mention. Tesla does not remedy software issues under warranty. Service center is obviously useless.

You may find these things minor but in $100K car I expect perfection and not annoyances. If you are a geek and want smartphone on wheels and OK with paying money for being software tester for Tesla, then by all means, go ahead. If you actually want luxury car without hassles, look elsewhere.",0
"Very Cheap interior for a so-called ""luxury"" car.",0
"Not a bad car, gas mileage is not overwhelming in my hybrid, (mid thirties). WHY WOULD YOU SELL ANYONE A CAR WITH NO SPARE TIRE, incovenient if not down right life threatening depending on circumstanse. If you buy new they also sneak in a charge for tire disposal?, charge for nitrogen in your tires, and one other ridiculous charge that slips my mind at the moment.  The car automatically goes to econo setting when turned off which has very little zip if you are pulling into traffic so you have to remember to switch to regular or sport for normal driving around town. ALSO AND PAY ATTENTION NOW...DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY ARE ON SALE.  Three weeks after i bought mine they had a $5000.00 off sale and six weeks later it was $6000.00 off. It is an ok car but i enjoyed my 2006 more all the way around. I would look around a bit more before i bought Hyundai again. When i approached them about the sale price they would not even consider throwing in a spare tire to address my wounded pocket book. This after sale treatment was from Murdock Hyundai in Orem Ut.  I assume the other spare tire and extra charges are generally the same everywhere. I am a owner and not just a competing dealership, you can text me at 801.830.6022 if you want verification, thanks for your time.",0
"I like the car and all the features but I hate the transmission. When trying to change lanes, the car dies. Almost killed myself numerous times. Went back to the dealer and he noticed the issue while he had the car for a test drive. Hyundai has no fix. Until they do, I will be driving our other car in the family.",0
"Low on power.  Funny noises.  When shut it off there are two thunk sounds and then a clang sound from the exhause, I guess.  I asked about it at the dealer and they said it was normal.  I doubt it.  No I ever owned did that.  Including other Hyundai products.  I heard that the ""America's Best Warranty"" was not really that because when you have something like this, they just say its normal.  There is also a loose component in the right rear of the car that has a loose, hollow, rattly noise over bumps. Also, when slow down and then start to accelerate again, like in traffic, or at a turn, etc., there a buzzy rattly noise from underneath, before it downshifts to a lower gear.  Also, at times, and for some unknown reason, even in our CT winter temps (we got the car in November), the A/C and A/C windshield defogger are on by themselves and have to be manually shut off to go back to heat.  And one of the rear hatch struts makes clunky noises (the left one never does and just goes up and down without any noise) when the hatch is lifted open and shut.
So, buyer beware.
Finally, gas mileage with this smaller 2.0 liter engine (our last vehicle was a 2.4 liter KIA Sportage - also a Hyundai product - and we had also previously had a Hyundai Sonata with the 2.4) is no better than the larger engine 2.4 liter.  But they don't put that in it anymore (up to 2015 they did).  So I don't know what the point of going downsize with the engine was if the fuel mileage is not any better.",0

Dinghy towing the Jeep behind my motorhome, I noticed violent shaking of the motorhome caused by the jeep's front end.  I had the jeep towed to the dealer and as of this date, Jan 28, 2017, the dealer still has my vehicle.  The diagnosis is a differential track bar that is built on the differential housing.

"If you drive alot. This is not for you. Puny gas tank. Maybe 350 miles on a tank of gas if your lucky. It slows down on hills. Up to 5mph up a hill is lost. I traded it. Not for me.

Have had the car since July 2016. When we picked it up at the dealership the tailight was out. Have had too have brake pads and rotors replaced at 7500 miles. Have had it in three times for problems with traction control kicking on while making a left turn on dry pavement and normal acceleration causing power loss to the engine with on coming traffic. Dealer says there is nothing being detected in the computer. This is a serious safety issue. Wouldn't recommend this one to anyone. Very disappointing.,0
"Had this car for 2 months as a rental while our Honda was in for airbag recall, couldn't wait to get back to a 5 year old car instead of this. So weak, and awkward and ugly with annoying features. What time is it? Have to turn on the radio to find out. Want to go up a small incline? Too bad. No idea who this car would be aimed at. At least it didn't break down, so not 1 star.",0
"Doesn't cool down in 30 minutes.  We bought a brand new 2016 Honda Odyssey and the car is incapable of cooling down!!!!  Even the manager where we bought the car said that's the way with all new Odyssey's--it can take up to 45 minutes to cool down.  So I do what any normal person would do and call Honda Corp.  The manager we got first said it should take max 3-5 minutes to cool down.  Then he called the dealership and changed his tune.  He then informed us that FL is hot. (Something we apparently weren't aware of--we just live here.)  The inside of the car can reach up to 140 degrees and it takes a while to cool down.  By that logic, the engineers didn't account for 3/4 of the US since it was hotter in the Northeast and Southwest than it was in FL this year.  However, it will not cool down in less than 1/2 an hour and apparently we have to live with it.  Strange how our 2011 HONDA CR-V and our former 2009 Toyota Sienna could cool down despite the heat.  I have called Honda numerous times and they will not even acknowledge there is a problem.  I have a business and my client's office is 10 minutes down the road.  I showed up in sweat!!!  I was pouring sweat and it was VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  This is from a brand new car!!!  If you are considering a Honda Odyssey and live anywhere where it might get hot--DON'T DO IT!!!  It's not worth it!!!  The electronics are pretty cool, but it's not worth driving to and from work in the heat!!!  It's just not!!!",0
"CVT transmission is junk. Had to replace mine at the 20k mile mark. Key Fab battery is weak as well, keeps dying. Very disappointing for a 2016, had a 2013 Infiniti g37x, 40k miles, car gave me NO PROBLEMS.",0
"Okay first off, the car looks awesome and drives great!!. There's a lot to like about the new civic and with a little refinement, it would be by far the best car on the road!!!!
Pro:
=Looks!! Off the chart!! 5 starts!!!
=Power (1.5 turbo) It may be small but its does an awesome job!. I mean don't get me wrong its not a sleeper by any means, but I can get in and out of traffic when I need.
= MPG, i average around 80 mph when driving and the car consistently gets 35 to 38 depending on the wind
= Interior looks like it belongs in an over priced BMW
= Did i mention looks?
= Handling, coming from an SX kia optima (which i do miss the 2.0 turbo), the handling is significantly better
= Lane assist is great for long trips when you're a little sleepy
= Instrument cluster looks high tech and its easy to use. they make it very easy to switch function from the steering wheel

CONS
= the board of the seat ( the bottom part) is way to short. They should have put the accord seat in this car.
= Seats are somewhat uncomfortable.
= The subwoofer has a rattle from the factory, i fixed it by shoving an old shop rag in between the rear brake light
= the infotainment center is laggy and complicated at best
= NO VOLUME button for the stereo. If they wanted to make this change, they should have had the rest of the stereo working much better
= There is rattle in by the driver side door that my vehicle has and many have complained about in the forums
= no light in the glove compartment. doesn't seem like a big deal till its dark and you frequently throw your wallet in there...
= Sound system is sub-par for a premium system, my stock kia optima blew it away
= Back up camera is horrible, again my 4 year old car that is in the same price range was much better
= Navigation gets lost more than my grandma, and unless im on a main highway, it seem like its unable to connect.
=No fan speed selection, again, if they are going to go all digital, come up with a digital controller that doesnt take 40 seconds to start working
= NO LUMBAR support, which might be why the seats are uncomfortable
= Blind side camera is as bad as the back up
= apple play has bugs in it that won't allow you to listen to audio books

I use the car for commuting about",0
"This 35K car has a $5 navigation system  (SCOUT GPS).  I love my car but HATE the crappy navigation and this will be my first and LAST TOYOTA! Waze or Google Auto would save this but why have a big navigation screen if you can't use it to navigate? Seriously Toyota,  that's the best you have to offer? REFUND?",0
"As much as I wanted to love this truck , I just can't . The driveline vibrations that haunted previous generations are not fixed , coupled with some new and considerable common issues.
And , as before , the customer is left in the hands of the dealerships who can't fix what Toyota will not fix .",0
Around town under 15 mpg and on open highway maybe if I let it coast downhill it may get 17 mpg. The 3.5 Atkinson motor is a joke and a half not responding very. Good nor when it does respond to uphill it downshifts to 4th not 5th since you really have to put your foot into it to get it to respond. It will hold to 4th all the way up the grade. Even if you try letting up on the gas as your going up it will not upshift until you e at the top of the hill. Towing a load is a Forrest joke also and it will not get any gas mileage at all but about nine.nine mpg. Seats are hard to get use to since it looks like your sitting below the steering wheel and as others have mentioned to power seats in a forty thousand dollar truck. I am not a happy camper when it comes to the new third generation of the truck. Maybe the forth is on its way in a lot faster than the second generation lasted.,0
I bought this truck a year ago and to be honest I'm not thrilled. The seats are not the most comfortable. The gas cap door has no lock! I should have noticed some of this but I missed that. I traded in a Honda Ridgeline for this and I wish I had waited for the new Ridgeline. There are a lot of little things that I miss but my biggest beef is gas mileage. I tow my boat. I took the exact same boat on the exact same route with the exact same load as always. With my old truck over 8 trips my mileage was 15 to 16 miles per gallon. Now with the Toyota I was lucky to get 11 MPG. That is about 50% loss of mileage. I wish I had waited for the new Ridgeline!,0
"Taking mine back to dealer today for the 5k service and hoping they can resolve the transmission issue. Took it in once to have the trans fluid checked and when I was going home, I look at the copy of work they did. They checked everything but the trans fluid, avoid AutoNation in Leesburg VA. They also don't want to fix my transmission issue and try and play dumb like they never heard about any issues. They are going to hear it today and maybe everyone else in the building. Wish me luck!!! lol",0
"I bought mine (TRD Off-Road) back in January after wanting one since I was 15 years old. I love the truck, but I also hate it. It looks fantastic and the interior fit and finish put the GM twins to shame. Add to that some sweet off road features and a badass design and you have a recipe for the perfect truck. Plus its a Toyota Tacoma its gonna get 200K+ miles easy, right??

 Almost immediately I started having problems with the truck. I guess it might be best to just list them as things to look out for. They seem fairly common, but some people don't have the issues with their trucks.

1. The rear differential howls. Mine was replaced at 2K miles (because of the howling), but that didn't fix it. Most 3rd gens do it. Feather the throttle between 55-65mph and it will sing for you. They can't fix it and just continue to replace differentials. Some people are on their 3rd diff. Toyota is well aware of this. I've been told ""its a characteristic of the vehicle"".
2. The drive line/truck vibrates like you are driving over a rumble strip when you come to a stop (~25 -> 0mph). There is no Toyota sanctioned fix for this. They are aware of it--its a also ""characteristic of the vehicle""
3. There is a pronounce vibration at 1800-2300RPM under load. So driving down the highway the truck will get noticeably louder and high-freq vibrate. Once you are out of that range its fine. You guessed it ""characteristic of the vehicle""
4. The transmission is garbage BUT, credit where it's due, Toyota released a TSB that reprograms it and that made a HUGEE difference. Its like a different truck. Unfortunately, '17s are still coming out of the factory in need of the TSB.
5. Another problem that was fixed by a TSB is the lower control arms whistle like a flute (but the TSB includes plugs that plug the holes that cause the problems)
6. My brake pedal pulsates/vibrates. I've been told this is normal; ""its the brake accumulator and thats how it works"". I've never driven a vehicle whose brakes vibrated ""normally"". IMO its very disconcerting.

Those are the bigger issues. There are some small criticisms, but they all seem super trivial compared to the powertrain/driveline issues listed above (like the fact that its keyless except for the new locking tailgate..so you still have to carry a key around with you or the lack of a power seat in 2016).

I really see a lot of potential in this truck. It would be the perfect truck for me if I didn't want to pull my hair out every time I hop in it.  It's really unfortunate that these new Tacomas are having issues like this (issues people made fun of american cars for having in the 80's).I've been at the dealership a dozen times since January. That's quite literally the same amount of times all of my previous vehicles had been in the shop, for non-routine service, combined.",0
The tranny is horrible.,0
"My Tacoma was a loaded up TRD off road. It road really rough even after I put on better tires. The engine was ok but it wouldn't out run a turtle. But the worst part is they are so plain Jane. As I said, mine was loaded up but it did not have normal options that other trucks have. No remote start was offered from the factory. The sliding rear window was manual so when I wanted to close it I had to stop and get out to close it. The tailgate was lockable but I had to use a different key that did not fit anything else so I had to carry a extra key. Every other truck maker unlocks the tailgate when the doors are unlocked. If I wanted to put the back seat down I had to remove the headrests. Heck, by the time I stored the headrests there wasn't much room left to load the items I wanted to put back there. I guess most people who love Tacoma trucks have never had a new luxury offering from GM or Ford. I sold my Tacoma with 2000 miles and took a $7000 loss so the resale is not very good either.",0
"Options on Denali package are meager, though GM is demanding upscale pricing.  No locking tailgate, no garage remotes, no rear seat pocket on drivers seat, no memory seats, and scant driving aids with navigation package.  Dash displays and options are limited.  I will look at new Ford Ranger of go to the old reliable standby, Toyota.",0
"What I have:
2017 2SS Camaro with premium audio and a manual transmission

Still running off pushrod technology

"i recently test drove a santa fe limited ultamite and i am very unpleased with this car
to start off this car is dangerous when trying to make quick right turns as i was test driving and wanted to make a right turn, the issue is that the vehicle boggs down when you hit the accelerator after braking in my mind in certain situation that is a serious issue.
another issue is that the suspension is rough i had friend riding in the back with me and they said it felt like riding a horse, and you can hear every little bump you go across. the car looks good in general i like the features it has to offer but the build quality of this car is trash",0
"This was my dream car until I purchased one. Definitely not a family car. The interior space is very limited and the car amenities (eg radio, nav, ac controls) just lack overall usability. From the ac sync to the radio always turning on aotumaticslly when starting the car it frankly just has a number of annoying features.

The car drives and handles smoothly.",0
"At first, love the car and all the safety features, eg the eyesight, adaptive cruise control, etc. Then less than one month, suddenly found the CD player was intermittently working!!! Never heard of failed CD player on computer or laptop! It is a big surprise and huge disappointment! Right now the technology for CD player is so mature. The price is so cheap. However, Subaru still can NOT get a high quality and working CD player!!!??

So disappointment!!!!",0
"The truck is great but the 8 speed transmission that makes it go is the pits and GM cant or will not fix it  The transmission problems on this truck and every one else who has a 8 speed trans (just read on line) makes this truck a why did I buy it never again  Had my go around with Ford 6.0 so Toyota is looking pretty good, their cars never break",0
"Not even 1,000 miles on my High country truck, disappointed!  2 recalls on the airbag and the forward collision system programming.  So far my AC has broken, the gas tank was replaced on a bulletin and the infotainment radio needed new software.  I am not a guinea pig with a $63K truck.  Only made 1 payment so far, huge regret buying.",0

I'm soooo happy I purchased the extended warranty.  I've had both turbos replaced and the AC system replaced ... all under warranty.  It now needs the primary timing chain replaced.  That is not covered under warranty and the shop quoted me over $4000 to do the job.  I spent less than $900 on parts to do the job myself.  I will never buy another F150.  Too many failures in the engine bay.  This model has the 3.7 EcoBoost motor and I have been diligent about routine maintenance.",0
No amount; for this (Replica) ,0

This year Camaro with a 2.8 L V6 does not have enough power. I spent a lot of time restoring this vehicle because I like the looks the T-Tops the 5 speed manual transmission but it does not have enough power to get out of it's own way. I think may NOS will be a solution.,0
I didn't know when I bought this car a year ago that it was going to be a project car.  I love the car but have had a LOT of problems getting someone to work on  TPI. It has been a night mare trying to get it adjusted properly. The wiring was screwed up so that caused me problems. I have an overheating problem when I turn the A/C on. The engine is completely rebuilt and has a 165 degree thermostat. My only option at this point is to pull the radiator. All this has taken over a year and I still haven't been able to drive it without a problem. BUYERS beware<<< It is almost impossible to get anyone to work on it because of it's age and the TPI....,0
The web site read that this particular part would fit my car.  The part ordered did not fit and had to be returned. It was the ONLY one that did not fit. I have ordered other car parts that were very satisfactory along with all my other products I have ordered through Amazon and was very satisfied.  Robert,0
never buy an old car uness e a mechanic,0

"Vehicle was super reliable, but the chassis was of the most inferior steel ever made. Totally rusted. Chassis actually split in half. It was an absolute shame, because this vehicle never let me down. This vehicle drove through 3 foot snowstorms. I was sad to see it go. I had to junk it.",0
Have to give it 2 stars because these vans have by far the worst transmission ever designed and used buy a major car company. The sad part is they attached that horrible transmission to a solid motor. I bought this van for 500 bucks and drove it for 2 years. It was a beast with the 3.8 liter sideways V6. It actually did pretty well on mileage as well averaging 22-25 mpg for me. The transmission died to soon. I would have driven this van for many more years.,0

"This car is made to last about 6 years, then owners will start going banckrupt by having to spend so much money given to mechanics to maintain weakly thought trought and weakly built american made vehicle...  unless the owner is competent handy mechanic type and able to anticipate problems and take corrective measures and buy and install needed parts, then it will last indefinitely...  Since owning mine I glued fallen off mirror to windshield, weather-proofed leaking door weather seal, flushed engine once and radiator a few times, replaced transmission hoses and filter, replaced electronic ignition module (big-improvement), O2-sensor, EGR valve, installed larger exaust pipes after catalic-converter removing resonator then used a v8-5L engine stainless-steel mufler for much better flow without the noise, decarboned stuff with Seafoam, installed new spark plugs and better wires, brake pads all around, tires, replaced gasoline tank, fixed bent metal bar responsible for door openings, replaced keys, glued-fixed turn signal, replaced heater-core, replaced 195f thermostat with 180f for engine to run cooler then adjusted temp sensor via resistor to trick computer to think it is running hot enough, engineered spark-plug-riser to pull O2 sensor slightly out of exaust stream this runs leaner more gasoline efficient (36-38mpg with+92 gas) perfect for hot California summers but I reverse it for colder winters otherwise hard start in cold...  (got 34MPH @ 68mph avg V over 800 miles round-trip in JUN-2017)...  (going to add hydrogen-oxygen from water using electricity into vacum line conversion in 2017)... painted it but used just cheap spray cans from Walmart...  saved hotel costs for 18 months while toured USA by comfortably and gladly sleeping in front seat with amry sleeping bag, also tent camped US National Parks with all equipment +food +water loaded into trunk and back seat, cooked espresso coffe, scrambled-eggs, bacon, soups, breakfasts in car on open flame butane camping stove from flat surface by transmission gear shifter...  so I love it for being usefull dependable never let you down reliable transportation and simultaneously I hate it for needing maintenance that other manufacturers likely would not be needing... so... I really should not complain...  but anyone else not having type-a fix-it-your-self perfectionist personality would have given up on this car long time ago for likely bankrupting them in fixing things by paying other people to fix them if avalance of inperfections with car bothers them like it bothers me...

Its a money pit,0
Riddled with stupid problems. Worst vehicle ever. Emissions and computer problems.,0
Why the heck they decided to cram a 3.8 liter v6 in that engine compartment mounted transversely is beyond me. Many task become quite labor intensive due to lack of space.  Typical 90's domestic car.  decent interior.  nothing fancy,0
"It runs but pretty much everything else stopped working. Heat and A/C system, brakes, fuel line, etc. So far spent almost $3,000 on a van I paid $2,000 for.",0
Company was great to work with but the parts were 1 1/2 too short.,0
"It has 66,000 miles and is falling apart. AC pump leaked from new.  4x4 transfer case ground up on its own due to excessive factory RTV silicone clogging the transfer case oil pump. The rear axle howls. Gone thru 3 ac/delco alternators. Rear windshield wiper does not actually touch the glass. The clock has always lost time frequently. The distributor is completely made of plastic, fires erratically. Had that notorious coolant intake leak. Also the plastic half of the intake and the fuel injection is a joke, and really hard to service compared to other vehicles. Had to replace the u-joints. Found out they inject plastic around them instead of using metal clips. Really?? Who thought of that? Wait until you need to service them. You will have to spend a lot of time heating up the parts until the plastic oozes out. Then you can press out the u-joint. Then heat the yokes again to remove the rest of the plastic from the yoke. Unbelievable!",0
"A unique car, they only made this version for a few years. The Lt1 motor leaves some things to desire, thy bury the distributor behind the crank pulley and he water pump making the distributor cap replacement painful at best. The design leads to random misfire due to the distributor design.",0
Everything on the car is made of plastic that shouldn't have survived more than 5 years of use. What remains cracks and breaks or just falls off the car. The only thing in the car that is fairly sound is the engine. Although even the exhaust manifold had a crack all the way through it so I guess even that is not free of poor workmanship. I've seen a lot of Geo's at the junkyard that have their struts pushing through the top into the engine bay and can easy tell that's the reason for the car wrecking. This should've been a $5000 car new.,0
Don't buy...,0
"Loved the car, but it turned out to have to much rust underneath. Bought a 2014 instead.",0

"I got my 97 Nissan Maxima 6 years ago,it had 97,000 Miles on it when I purchased it and I bought it from a elderly couple I knew and they took real good care of the car. They changed the oil every 3,000miles and when they had maintenance done on the car (which was rarely) when I got the car after 110,000 miles everything started going wrong with the car from the radiator to the valve cover gaskets and everything in between. I just recently replaced the front and rear struts and the front end suspension,I've sunk alot of money and sweat so it would be silly to try and get rid of it now because I done changed just about everything in the vehicle but if I had the chance to change my decision on purchasing another vehicle at that time I would do so in a heartbeat.

"When it runs well, the mileage is great, about 46 mpg. But perpetual oil leaks from the oil pan, despite new pans, different gaskets,etc. The bolts that hold the pan frequently strip the aluminum threads in the block, so you have to helicoil them. Very temperature sensitive, have had to put new head gaskets in 3 times. And the crankshaft position sensor a number of times. Things are tight in the engine space, had to cut the wheel well with a cut-off wheel to get at the crankshaft bolt, and use a hydraulic spreader to get the crankshaft pulley out. I have done a lot of work on them. If you buy a used one, make sure of the frequency of oil changes, the amount of oil leakage, and do a compression test. Also check the transmission output shafts for boot leaks, the ball joints (wiggle the tire in and out, or lift the vehicle and wobble the tire). Don't pay over $1200.00",0

It is fun to drive with a great front-to-rear weight balance. It's not the fastest car, but it's definitely fun. This is where the good part ends.

The 5 speed manual transmission has a long throw. The clutch has a very small ""sweet spot"" making it easy to pop the clutch and lug the motor or you ride the clutch to keep this from happening. Most of my cars are manuals, and this is the only one I have these problems with. So does anyone else who drives it.

The interior doesn't have any significant storage space. Not even a glove box. No cup holders. Just two pockets under the armrests in each door and a small center console. There is also a very small and not easily accessible storage area on top of the engine compartment behind your head.

I keep hearing people talk about ""fine German engineering"" and ""POrSche"" in the same sentence. Clearly the people who say this are as drunk as the engineers were who designed this car. Or have never owned one.

The car is famous for many issues. Premature rear main seal failure. Air bag light issues. O2 sensors failing prematurely. There are more, (visit POrSche discussion forums like RennTech and Dorkiphus so see how bad these cars are) but these are the big ones that come to mind. All are expensive to fix, and Porsche refused to recall any of them. The only cheap one to fix is the ignition cylinder breaking, which is a good thing, because I've had to replace mine 3 times so far. In 56,000 miles. But talk about a HUGE pain in the a$$ to fix.

But the best one is my favorite flaw.

It is a given that moisture gets into cars. It is a bigger given that more moisture gets into convertibles than into hardtops. Knowing this, it takes a Super Genius on par with Wile E. Coyote to put the anti-theft computer in the floor of a convertible. (I bet you can see where I'm going with this!)

As we all know, water and electronics don't play well together. So, after a few years of being exposed to wet conditions the anti-theft computer implodes. When this happens, the car thinks it's been stolen and immobilizes itself. Nothing works. Not the windows, the steering, the radio....NOTHING.

So, you take your $50,000 boat anchor to the nearest POrSche dealership. They remove your fried computer with the corrupted data and install a nice new computer.  The problem is, the new computer has no data. You don't program the car to the new computer; you program the new computer to the car using the now corrupt data from the old computer. Yes, they extract as much data as they can from the old computer and hope it's enough to run the car with the new computer. If there's not enough data, your car is totaled.

In my case, there was enough data to get my car running again. But corrupt data is still corrupt data. My car is now plagued with electrical Gremlins and there is nothing to be done about it.

1. There is a constant drain on the battery. The car will kill the battery in less than 48 hours. Solution: install a battery disconnect switch and disconnect the battery whenever you're not driving.
2. The radio is dead. Done. Finished. Kaput.
3. My car was not originally programmed with daytime running lights. I now have them. Sometimes.
4. The car came with auto up and auto down windows where you don't have to hold the button to get the windows to go all the way up/down. Post-brain transplant, sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. And sometimes the windows roll up reeeeeeallly slowly.
5. Regarding the auto up/down of the windows, sometimes they roll down all by themselves. And when you roll them up, they go right back down. A nice feature when it rains.
6. Sometimes the hazard lights start flashing by themselves. This is often followed by all the idiot lights flashing on the dash. Lots of pretty colors! Hope you're not prone to seizures.
7. The buttons on the keys no longer work. You have to manually lock/unlock the car. Except the car may or may not actually lock. It may immediately unlock itself. The alarm may or may not work. Depends on the mood...
8. The digital gauges will flicker randomly. Like the car is suddenly possessed.
9. The horn will start blowing fo no reason. Other drivers find this annoying for some reason. Oh wait, so do I.

Aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?",0

"generally poor engineering of body design, aluminum distributor cap terminals corrode and prevent starting - unlike brass other people use, replacing brake light switch which is prone to failure requires steering column removal.  Rocker panels prone to rusting out. I only keep it becauser my limited use cannot justify the cost of replacing - wish I had gotten an F250.  Others report many electrical failures with chevy trucks.",0

"Within a month of purchase the engine blew a head gasket, leaving me and my small children stranded.  Ford was good about the repairs, but I would never buy a Windstar again based on the experience.",0
I have not had the best in this car.  I bought it used in 2000.  It is a 1998 model.  Very poor interior quality in the doors.  Thankfully I've been able to garage it most of its life. Electrical system sucks as well.,0
"Even though we were assured by the salesman and his manager  that Ford/Mercury had solved the transmission problems that had plagued the Taurus and Sable lines , after we purchased the car new, we found out that we had been lied to !!
We have had to replace the  transmission many times!!
Thank GOD for extended warranties.- but we ended up having to buy 2 new transmissions.... sigh...
Finally we had the transmission replaced by someone other than FORD and that was the end of our transmission problems.
We will never buy a Ford product again or do business with Galpin Ford..... a very unpleasant and costly experience. ... sigh....
We have to work hard for our money and never expected to be lied to at the largest Ford dealer in the world and have to spend thousands of dollars to make up for sleazy sales tactics.",0
"It's a ford! Not a ford fan. Was changing jobs and becoming a commuter so I needed a 4 banger for a daily driver. This is the third ford product I bought in this age group that everything on one corner of the car was rusting out. I mean everything, for example r/r corner, backing plate for brakes rusted thin, shocks, springs, mounts, frame inner quarter panel all have EXCESSIVE rust. The rest of the car looks like any other car underneath at it's age. It was't until I was cleaning the undercarriage and removed all the road crud that I discovered it. An escort I had (same year) was the same on a front corner. That one had extremely low mileage and was a hand me down. Never would have paid for it. Sorry so bleak but, check the car on a lift before buying. As I said, I bought three in a row this way. Never bought Fords in the past, never will again.",0
"Audi's flagship model is an embarrassment as far as resale value.  Some of the new models vary around $130,000, but when I looked into trading for something newer I was told it was only worth $18,000.  That's over $12,000 per year in depreciation!  Doesn't make any sense for a luxury auto or any auto for that matter, to lose that much value.  I have also spent over $12,000 in repairs over the last few years.  Nothing on this vehicle is inexpensive and don't even ask about Audi labor charges at the dealership- approximately $200 per hour!  My lawyer doesn't charge that much...",0

"I owned a 1991, 3.3L Grand Caravan for 10 years until I learned the head gasket was blown.  Since I was very familiar doing most of my own maintenance on that vehicle I figured it would be a safe move replacing it with a 1999, 3.3L Caravan.  WRONG!!!!!
Some Basic Maintenance Differences:
* Simple Fuel Filter Replacement -
1991....$5 filter easily replaced underneath vehible with screwdriver.
1999.....$30 filter + $75 to have a mechanic drop the gas tank to install.
*  Simple Spark Plugs Installation -
1991..... Minimal difficulty accessing the 3 rear plugs. Maybe 1/2 hour.
1999.....Went through holy hell accessing the 3 rear plugs!!  Over 2 hours!!?
*  Medium Difficulty Replacing Valve Cover Gaskets and Huge Difference In Gasket Price -
1991......$10 for gaskets.  Involves pulling the Plenum to access the rear Valve Cover. Maybe 1 hour.
1999.....$80 for gaskets....Involves taking off Wipers, Removing Wiper Assembly, Removing Plenum. Maybe 3 hours or pay a mechanic $150.
*  Medium Difficulty Radiator Replacement -
1991.....$60 1 Fan Radiator.....not very difficult to replace.  Maybe 1 hour.
1999.....$90  2 Fan Radiator....so difficult I had to pay another $110 to replace.
*  Tires and Gas Mileage -
1991.....15 inch Tires, Look Nice filling in the wheel wells, Easy to find Used,
 Better fuel mileage.
1999....14 inch Tires,  Small Ugly Look not filling out the wheel wells, Difficult To find Used and Michelin discontinued making them, More Dangerous, Poor Handling, and Quick Wear & Tear on the Fronts.
Worse Fuel Mileage.
*  Simple Air Filter Replacement -
1991......$5...Easy access...5 minutes.
1999......$8... Difficult access...30 minutes.

Who knows what else since I've only had it 2yrs.",0
A nice vehicle except the transmissions-had to replace it twice. Other than that it has held up. We have had to do this on both of the Caravans we have had.,0
"car has major issues, the transmissionis a big problem area.  the inside is nice and the awd is great.  havr also had problems with the turbo, cooling system, and car likes to run in limp mode alot",0
"It is somewhat more refined than my 52 Model.  4.0 doesnt really have enough power for the 31 tires and it should.  Rides bad, drives bad, electrical glitches, but looks cool.  Grandkids love to ride in it.",0
"It has many bad design elements to this vehicle, such as no way to open the back hatch door from inside, master cylinder under the dashboard compartment in the engine. A/C valve to fill up in front and you have to weave your hand from behind with enough room for your arm to get burned by the A/C lines.",0

"Lemon. Lemon. Lemon. Camshaft sensors, crankshaft sensors, coolant level and temperature sensors, MAP sensor, ignition switch, ignition key slot cylinder and theft sensor, EGR valve, fuel pressure regulator, fuel pump, intake gaskets, and now just within a week ago my automatic transmission looks like it was hit by a granade. Once any GM car gets about 140,000 miles on it, GET RID OF IT. It does get good mileage for a 6 cylinder at about 29 mpg on the highway. The radio is VERY good as well as in LOUD. The only GM cars I would ever own would be a Prizm, Tracker, Corvette, or Saturn and even then, in the case of the Saturn, I would hesitate.",0
"Chevrolet took over this from Toyota in 1998 and pretty much ruined this brand..I have owned several geo prizms over the years and absolutely love them..I bought this one and have regretted it since I've owned it..You can count on 4 things going wrong with these generally after 50,000 miles.  .(1) AC compressor is junk, Search for these used on the web and almost all of them have no A/C (2) Motor was designed wrong and starts using oil heavily..Mine gets around 700 miles per quart..(3)  Door seals start falling apart (4) Evap canister assembly in rear of car shells out around the same time..",0

Mine has been a nightmare. Brake problems, differential problems, now steering assembly problems, what's next? Probably clutch and transmission and the differential again as the used one the mechanic put in doesn't seem that good.
The problem with this car is that it was made under like 5 names by different manufacturers so it's hard to get the right parts.
It has some Suzuki parts, some GM parts, sometimes it uses ""GEO"" parts, sometimes Chevy, sometimes Suzuki.
Made in USA, made in Canada, made in Europe...

"Decent cars, however many things don't hold up on them. Intake gaskets are junk, they warp rotors like crazy, random check engine light for no reason, upper intakes are junk and transmissions are so weak that you'd think they are made out of water balloons and tissue paper. Oh, and they rust really bad in the subframe mount areas, the rockers and the wheelwells. If you live in a salt state, avoid one used. This goes the same way with its' counterparts, the Bonneville, LeSabre and Park Avenue.",0

"Nice looking trucks but that's about it. They all rust out quickly anymore and I knew that would be the case when I got this Chevy. I opted for the 2500 6.0 because I thought it would be a great truck to pull a small travel trailer with no problem, boy was I wrong. It loses power and stalls out pulling it  up hills. I have spent a lot of money trying to figure this out to no avail. I had Baker engineering go through it and street tune it. Replaced the fuel pump/ filter, the erg valve, the mass air flow sensor, plugs and wires, the crank positioning sensor, I thought maybe it could be the Chinese fuel pump could be the problem so I ordered a name brand one only to find out that's made in china as well. Plus I ditched the k & n air filter that I had put in it after being told that the oil in them could cause the mass flow sensor to fail.  Anyways I just ordered a throttle positioning sensor to give it a try....Truck is slowly becoming a 2018 truck, part by part!",0
"Nice overall design -- a nice looking car that still looks good. However, the transmission failed to go into reverse a few years ago and that cost me about 4K. BMW would not give me a dime towards the repair even though this problem wias pretty common to the make, model and year. Once the car passed 100,000 miles I seem to have a problem with something costly every 8 months or so. Fortunately, I found repair shops willing to replace parts purchased off the Internet. That keeps the cost of owning down to where I can still manage it. Would I buy another BMW ever again? No. I'm leaning towards a Toyota or Subaru where I think one gets good value for their money.",0

"Before this I had three in the 80s and 90s, they ran forever no major problems, that is why I brought the 2000, bad idea! It ran good for the first 60,000 mi and then problems started. First was failure was the CAT. Then the ubiquitous rear wheel bearing failures. I have replace 8 rear wheel bearings so far, 1 front wheel bearing at 160,000 miles (which is kind of what you would expect). Cooling system problems, 120,000 mi replaced everything and finally both head gaskets. 50,000 mi later we did another two head gaskets. A new clutch. what is interesting is that the factory clutch never work correctly, but the after market clutch was superb?? Parking brake cables, a  few brake jobs, The last strange thing seems to the infamous P0420 CEL.  3 CATs, 6 O2 sensors, three ignition coils. Finally part of the problem turned out to be Bosch spark plugs (4 electrode) in a this engine is a no no. I think we finally stopped the CEL. Basically what they what they designed right worked well what they did not was a disaster. I get a chuckle watching the Subaru commercial with the guy giving the keys to his daughter. What they don't show you is he sent her through Auto Tech trade school, bought her a complete set of SKF tools and a warehouse full of spare parts.",0

"This car has great performance and handling, good fuel economy and plenty of space. On the down side the electrical system is the very worst of any car I have ever owned. Relays die, ECM died, A/C clutch died, crank position sensor died, O2 sensors died, back lights for odometer and radio dead! Coolant leaks around gaskets and belt tensioner bearing failure are other issues. You never know what is going to die next. All at less than 125,000 miles. I have a 5 year older Ford product with 195,000 miles that has only needed an alternator replacement.
 No more GM cars in this garage!",0
"My parents have one. I drive it once in a while and every time I notice something new being broken. Transmission is a notorious problem with this model.

It is an older design, still has chassis, feels and is heavy, acceleration is moderate, while fuel consumption is high and handling mediocre.",0
lot's of trouble's electrical system being the biggest of all.,0
"The usual Saab headaches. Oil consumption was high, due primarily to two reasons: the well known crankcase ventilation/breather box, and as a result, the turbo seals. The car was a real mosquito killer, and other drivers cursed my very existence. Oil smoke everywhere.

The fuel pump is expensive, and unlike the Saab 9-5, you can't remove it through the access hole under the rear seat. Do NOT BUY A CHEAP CHINESE FUEL PUMP. I did, and it lasted all of two weeks before quitting cold.

There's a lot about this car that's impossibly hard to work on (water pump is a pain to get to, belt tensioner just as bad). Some stuff (turbo, exhaust components) are great. But you'll love taking the whole front fascia off to replace a radiator.

Other than all that, the car was pretty quick after I got boost issues sorted out.

One other thing: the power steering does NOT use regular fluid or ATF. You need the euro spec stuff.",0
"Unreliable.  low mileage yet it has had many challenge.  rack & pinion, coil, idle speed control valve, cam position sensor and shaft and now transmission.",0
Should not have skimped on the body I have one that won't pass pa state inspection due to rust on the bottom of the car I wasted my money on this. Previous owner said it will pass it did not that said try to get 200 for it at a junkyard so I'm out 600 bucks,0

"Not a bad looking car but its turtle slow after 2nd gear (for highway merging and passing, it will go nowhere.). Even the 1.8L. The driving position isn't terrible but is a little different and will take some getting used to. At 32,500 miles, my transmission is leaking. Even with the manual antenna fully extended, radio connection is not always the best. And the sound system on the top end trim is weak for 6 speakers. The seats are quite uncomfortable. If you want to customize the car, just dont. Because there are no real mods or support for the 2000 protege. Not even a cold air intake. I expected it to handle better because the steering wheel is tighter than average, but it starts to understeer at a relatively low speed. the brakes are weak for even a 2500 lb car, it has no luxuries on even the top end trim; and I almost wish I had a civic instead! Also you can feel every transmission shift ouch. On the upside, the exterior design is quite good, the interior design is great although the center console is way to low, its quite easy to work on mechanically although the oil filter is in a stupid place, and well....thats kindof it...just buy the car if you like it but there are better options for the same money",0
security system poorly integrated an annoying,0
I didn't buy any car???????,0
Mine is a 2000. Only drove it 500 miles and timing belt has jumped. Its 4wd but cant get it in 4wd low. It's an extended cab 4 door and a lot of things already went bad. I'm not impressed with it at all,0
"Four cylinder, rough-riding 2WD base model, still driving daily at 220K miles BUT:
1) Has always been miserably slow, like driving a 1200cc VW from 1963-- you drive floorboarded most of the time, and can't maintain 75mph unloaded on even shallow highway hills. Forget about passing.
2) Economy 20 to 24 mpg-- should be better for so little power.
3) Mostly reliable-- in 200K miles: one clutch, one set of brakes, one fuel pump, two catalytic converters, 3 sets O2 sensors, 1 set of shocks (didn't help), several headlight bulbs and at least one of every other bulb; leaking rear main seal; A/C compressor wore out at 150K, did not fix; clutch master cylinder going now, and transmission showing its age.
4) Things that GM should have learned to make  in the last century break, crack, and fall off all over the car-- door hinges, wiper controls, radio knobs, seat parts, and all the plastic bits inside and out.
Bottom line: It's a miserable ride, but it starts almost everyday and I don't mind if it gets scratched or dinged. Would not buy the four cylinder or regular cab again.",0

Worst mini van ever,0
"Vehicle has a lot of plastic parts. If you're on the heavy side expect to break some if it. Center console is weak/fragile. The rear mounted spare tire is often stolen.

Of major note, this vehicle has a rash of problems reported to the Federal Highway Administration. The most maddening is the headlight failure.  The relays are mounted on the main board. Standard repair is to replace the board, at $400+. It starts with the headlight winking/flickering. Eventually it burns out completely. The FHA has chosen not to address this as a safety issue with an order for recall/repair. So, presumably, it's not a problem driving 70 mph, at midnight, in the middle of Montana with 1 headlight...

This is just 1 of the many electrical problems. If you pull the board and send it to a third party for repair. Most (in my experience all) will withdraw any warranty for their repair. The politest remark I've heard about the board is ""junk.""

The engine seems fair.

There are several different transmisions used on this vehicle. Pricey to have repaired.  Owner must keep up on regular maintenance.  Biannual filter change and fluid flush is a good idea.",0

Trans mission went out at about 150k miles and was replaces., lost the radio readout screen so you can't see what station you are on,  the front power accessory outlets blow the fuses all the time. Have replaced radiator, the part in fron of the radiator for the A/C, gas gauge has quit working, the power control on the drivers side front seat died, and also canno a just the seat back anymore. And of course the headlights fogged up really quick. Have replaced the one taillight circuit board due to it shorted out. I really think this vehicle should have been covered by the lemon law.

"The car is great to drive especially on curves at high speeds. But it is a pain in the ass to keep it out of the shop. I'am constantly having electrical issues with the car, I've lost count of the number of blower motor switches that I've replaced and the electric window regulator are constantly going out.",0
"If you look for reasons why GM went into bankruptcy here's a prime example. One of the very few things going for it is that it has the distinction of being one of the earliest cross over vehicles to hit the market. On paper it's a very nice car for it's time, and the optional 7 passenger seating is useful. And, it's a car which might be better than no car.
From the get go this is no more than a badge engineered Pontiac Aztek, also if it has anything else going for it, it's much better looking, but aside from a few luxury appointments, mechanically they're identical and even have an extremely similar sheet metal, especially toward the rear. The powertrain in this car is possibly one of the worst, the only available engine the 3.4L V6 only puts out 185HP, unfortunately this is a car that weighs 4,250lbs and that lack of power is very obvious, add in the 4 speed auto and the combo makes for a nail bitter while driving in hilly or mountainous terrain. Another let down would be the All Wheel Drive system GM labeled as ""VersaTrek"", it operates in part time only activating on demand when the wheel sensors detect slippage. Unlike most AWD system, this one once it encounters the smallest snow patch goes on to fail you. I've gone through 2 sets of all season tires, only to completely fail to the point the system is disabled. Now it could be the tires fault, but I also have a Mustang with summer performance tires which a couple of times drove with out issue through patches of snow the Buick would get stranded in. Another issue with the AWD is how easily it can break. The wheel hub sensor is connected via wire which is not only completely exposed but also extremely fragile. I lost count how many times we've had to replace the entire hub because the wire would have disintegrated from the elements. If you happen to get the sunroof be prepared for extensive maintenance, the car has a drain channel which easily clogs up and instead will drain into the driver's foot well, The sunroof caused numerous leaking issues, one time after heavy rain I actually had water streaming out from the OnStar mic.
When we bought the car we were smart enough to get the extended warranty, and much like Doug DeMuro's CarMax Range Rover, this warrenty to must of given GM's accountants nightmares. The car was continuously in and out of the shop for one critical failure after another. At one point we had to have the entire engine replaced, another time the AWD system had to be replaced as well. This pretty much was the epitome of GM build quality for it's day. I remember driving once on the highway with the cruise control on, only to see the car kept accelerating even after trying to disable it, with enough luck I was able to brake the car to slow down and get on the should to find that the cruise control got the throttle stuck open.
It's widely considered that the Chevy Cobalt is what brought down GM, but it's this Buick which foreshadowed it. Now I won't say to completely stay away from this car, especially since the 2004 and newer models did remedy a number of issues, such as the option for the 3.6L V6 which features 245hp. Another impressive point is the interior, sure it's not on par with BMW or Toyota, but compared to the rest of GM's lineup of the time it's pretty modern, and much nicer to look at than the typical GM plastic mess most of their cars had with a steering wheel that looks and feels like they been in storage since the 80s. This isn't a car that does anything particularly good or well, if anything it's not a bad place when you're on an extended journey or road trip. It's rather spacious for passengers and has a big car feel, sometimes I miss judge thinking the car is bigger than it actually is. Like I said, on paper it's a decent car.",0
"Motor blew at 124k, crappy brakes, lots of wheel bearings, 15 mpg down hill with a tailwind.  It's a dodge.",0
I am very happy with the service I recommend,0
Arrived ahead of time which is great.  Love the style of headlights. Looks exactly like the pic. Only giving 2 stars because the black plastic bracket that holds the headlight in place is broken on the passenger side headlight. Arrived in that condition upon delivery by FedEx. That was the only disappointment. Going to try and use some epoxy glue to fix it. Dont want to have to send it back and go through all of that.,0
"I am on my THIRD transmission, second (Ford OEM new) died two months after the warranty expired. ALSO, ABS brakes sensor light started up almost as soon as car was out of warranty and I have spent a couple thousand trying to get it (ABS system) working correctly. I gave up on that, Replaced rear differential gears - evidently mine takes F-150 gears as that is what the repair shop had to put in to get the right fit and function. Axle seals, crank-shaft sensor, seat-belt floor side assembly, ball joints (3 times over the years) one fell apart while I was driving. Oh yeah, for about 14 YEARS the emissions computer would not talk to anyone's analyzers so I always had to make a second trip to the DMV testing site. 15 years later it magically works on the analyzers( whaaa?). Lets see . . , auto door lock does not open the passenger side door after 10 years, my keys don't work in the front door, only the tailgate, went through about Four 4WD relay modules. My dealership is not in business anymore (Ford dealer went under about 2 years after purchase, not used, bought this new). I have so many $$$ into this I am afraid to get rid of it. I commute about 35 miles total a day. F-150 we have is one year older and had to have the engine replaced due to faulty head - spark plugs launching out from it issues. FORD used to be good, but I will not buy another one again. Sorry",0

I have put a lot of work and money into this car. Its hard to find someone who works on fords as it is abd this is a small compact engine. The problwms ive had with this car are to much to lost but i have found that they are common in this car.,0
The engine has always been great however the transmission and the catalytic converter are absolute garbage. I have had so many issues and as soon as I have fix those issues guess what those issues come right back. I love my piece of crap Jetta but I hate it as well. I cannot wait to trade this car in for something that actually works and I don't have to spend a ton of money fixing it just to get a new sticker for the license plate. All that being said I still love this stupid car,0
"not a good car at all, only reliable but kinda not really",0
"I bought this car new in 2002 when it was motor trend's car of the year. First time to buy a new car from the list. I can understand why it won way back then. but now all these years later, its been a lemon of a car. every problem you google about this car will happen to you. the catalytic converter will go out on you. the crankcase sensors will fail. valve cover leaks oil into the cylinders causing a misfire code. Ac problems. had the loss of heat problem last year in winter. that was nice. Hard start in cold and blows smoke when its doing it. It is a sporadic problem though. Love the idea of plastic door handles that are cheaply made. They break with ease. Wait till you have to change 1 or 2 of those and see how you feel about the car after that. I do all my own repairs and the way they make it drives you crazy. Oh and the headlight bulb replacement are a joy to replace in pairs. I will stop here and let you google the rest. Run from this car. Cant wait to trade it in.",0
he was obviously a nice car when it was new but now it's old and rotten.,0
"Something in the brake design is foul. I replace them too often. Car was cheap to buy originally. Noticed Kia became more expensive in the market place with the Nissan Versa becoming the front runner in least expensive cars. Biggest problems is the dealers who carry it. Engine had metal shavings in it. Dealer said engine had to be replaced [40,000 miles]. Cleaned the oil pan and I am at 110,000. Guess not too bad",0
Horribly designed engine in the 2.7L. Make sure it's a 3.5 if you get one or you'll regret it.,0
"Not a great car!  Nothing in or on it is meant for use, the leather seats stitching has all unwound, motor mounts have failed in less than 80,000 miles. the window regulators have had to be replaced. the plastic is crumbling to the touch just generally a poor product. I have had to replace most of the engine monitor/sensors. When I was a mechanic I would have loved this car, needs work all the time and nothing is easy to get too. When you compare it to the same year Ford Escort that has had none of the issues and has 188,000 miles on it.",0
The holes for the bulbs were too loose and the connectors would not hold. I had to buy additional o rings to make them stay. The plastic is thinner and it shows.,0
Never again.  Euro trash.,0

"4 stars for the truck and minus 2 for Dodge dealers.
I loved this truck; I drove it for 14 years but it had some problems. The transmission needed work after about 3 years, the extended warranty that I bought didn't cover anything and the Dodge dealers and service department were untrustworthy. I stopped using the Dodge service department after getting a second opinion and learning that they lied about repairs needed to the tune of about $1200. One good thing was because I didn't want to deal with Dodge I learned a lot about working on vehicles. I changed the alternater, serpentine belt, master brake cylinder, oil changes, etc. I also found a wonderful local mechanic who I have been able to recommend to people for their own cars. This truck was a beast, I called mine big red. I traded her in for a new car last summer and I still miss her. The new car is just a point A to point B type of vehicle but Big Red was my ride. She drove very well (for a pickup) and got me through a flood that saw lower profile vehicles stranded. It got me through heavy snow and ice. I always loved getting side eye from old dudes when my little self jumped down out of the cab. I only had one mechanical breakdown in the entire 14 years and that was when the gas tank fell off. That's when I traded her in because she was becoming more rust than metal. If you want to purchase a used one, don't spend too much, have a mechanic look at it first, check it for rust and get the dodge dakota maintenance book. I've driven a Nissan P/U and a Dodge Ram. The Ram's are enormous and not comparable, the Nissan was a stiff little piece of junk. Sadly, because of my experience with the Dodge dealers I'll never by another vehicle from the company but I'll always miss Big Red.",0
Still running but requires constant maintenance. Door locks and handles are broken and factory paint on car almost appears to have worn off. Basically a POS. My kid drives it.,0

Breaks down a lot.,0
"Disclaimer: This product was obtained at no cost as a very thoughtful, generous and well meaning gift from a dear relative (no sarcasm)
Now, to look this sumbitch horse square in the mouth----
Things that have broken despite monastic adherence to the maintenance schedule:
Fuel pump
Fuel level sensor
Driver's side power door lock actuator (just fell off, was riveted-in of course so good luck fixing it yourself)
The exact same plastic intake manifold that ford recalled for the '02 down but oh no, not the '03, sitting in a warehouse that extra year sure did the trick.
Horn
Cruise control
A/C
LCM (replaced under recall, still sucks and turns off whenever it pleases)
Turn signal stalk (no longer cancels automatically)
Cabin electrical system is shorting, god knows where.

Vehicle is currently running at about 150 misfires per minute (at idle) thanks to coolant flowing out of the cost-saving plastic intake manifold and pooling in the poorly-designed drainholes that are the plug access holes. Let me tell you the jerking and stumbling sensation is just wonderful when paired with a blinking check engine light, one simply must experience for themselves to understand. A simple lip around plug hole that the coil boot can fit over (something literally every other manufacturer has thought of) would have been more than adequate protection against this but it seems forward-thinking design was frowned upon within Ford's modular V8 design team. The leak also spills coolant onto hot engine parts which vents a cool James Bond smokescreen from the sides of your hood and is a Very Good Look at stoplights and the parking lot at work.
Ford wants $1300 to fix this straight up known and acknowledged manufacturing defect. We all want things.
Add to this a short (or possibly another cost-consciously engineered electrical module) that randomly and sometimes rapidly turns the interior lighting and headlights on and off (if they're in auto mode) and you have quite a formidable ride on your hands. Whenever the blinking happens you can hear a relay somewhere, god knows where, clicking on and off. Sometimes very rapidly, to the point that it's more a buzz than a click.
Sometimes it will drain its entire battery overnight for no discernible reason.
Not really a defect -more like a side effect- but kids trying to buy beer might take note: Driving this vehicle makes you appear at least 50 years and one narrowly escaped felony older than you actually are.",0
"Great car, but..
Very expensive to maintain.  Install spark plugs was about $400.  Entire top of engine needs to be removed.  Rear main seal leaks around 100K miles, takes about 12 hours to fix, oil cooler where the filter attaches leaks all the time.  The driver's  seat broke, a very common problem, if it goes to a dealer it is a $1500 repair, did it ourselves at a cost of $90 but it took 2 of us over 4 hours to make the repair.  Parts available online from Amazon.
Rear visibility is poor, smashed the tailgate because I didn't see a mailbox.
Changing the fog lights requires removing the wheel, removing 8 or 10 fasteners then squeezing your hand in a tight spot to get the bulb, on the passenger side you also have to loosen the bumper the get to the bulb behind the washer bottle.
If you are not a do-it-yourselfer don't waste your money, get something more serviceable.  I can't imagine the thoughts behind the engineers who designed this car.
I think this applies to 2003 t0 2007 Muranos.",0

"Wish I knew then, what I know now. These cars have had rear end issues (IRS) and tranny issues (solenoid pack) that develope most often around 80k miles.

If you want a comfortable solid German SUV at a fraction of the original price(new) then this is it.  If you want a reliable SUV that will not empty you savings within a few months of purchasing it then go with Toyota/Lexus.,0
"I had a 2004 (E53) 4.4i and LOVED it when it was brand new (to me) until it developed every single issue that plague these trucks. First the truck had a couple eletrical gremlins that would come and go. Rolling down the rear right window and not being able to roll it back up. Then the sunroof started leaking as the tracks are plastic and crack after years of weather and sun. This coupled with the drain in the driver-side A-pillar that comes apart on these models caused water to leak from the top and down into the driver's foot well.  Then the most fatal of them all developed. The ""Intermediate Lever / Eccentric shaft issue that develops due to cold weather. This has been a known issue by BMW for years, and there are service bulletins on it, but no recall. Once this issue starts showing symptoms, it's pretty much too late. Slowly the oil tracks in the engine gum up. You blow blue smoke, and have random misfires. Then it starts guzzling coolant and over heating. At the end then truck was literally undriveable. The engine receives no oil, spark, and thus no power. I limped it, steaming and smoking, to a dealer to trade it in on a more reliable SUV.

My advice: If you're looking; keep looking. If you own one and it runs; trade it off before it dies.",0
BMW's are great until you run out of warranty.  Check the common bmw and car forums out there... Maintenance is going to cost an arm and a leg.,0
Would be perfect if it actually fit,0
"If you are looking for a fixer upper, or something which gets you to the mountains and back after working on it, I would avoid this vehicle. While the interior spaciousness is nice, the roof rack for carrying kayaks around and the trailer hitch options are a plus, it is a pain to work on. The alternator went out on mine, but instead of being able to simply swap it out with a new one, I had to take it into the shop. The reason? Volvo decided to bury the alternator down underneath tubes and wires and metal bars, which meant if I wanted to replace it myself, I would have to take off the passenger headlight and side panel just to reach it. But I guess in Sweden, alternators never go out. Stupid. And there are many other items about the design of this vehicle which annoy me, especially since I'm a DIYer, such as a $90.00 price tag for a serpentine belt (because it is longer and bigger...whatever), oil filter which can't be accessed with a simple oil filter removal tool since it is buried so deep in the engine body, a special type of rear differential which takes a special kind of differential fluid and is not cheap, and many, many more annoyances. Not a vehicle worth your time or effort if you want a project vehicle.",0
"While the car has been very reliable and mechanically sound, it has been falling apart from the inside out pretty much since I got it in 2006.  They used very cheap materials for items like the dash, resulting in the plastic bubbling and warping from heat and sunlight.
Other items relating to the interior and body have been failing one by one, but the engine still starts and runs reliably.
While I did get my money's worth out of the car, opening it has not been a very satisfying experience.",0
"The 2004 Kia Spectra is a poorly manufactured car with cheap materials. After about 50,000 miles our seats ripped at the seams. Around 75,000 miles, the car had several brake system leaks. The sun visor failed to stay up at that time too. The third tail light's plastic deteriorated under normal conditions, and has started to crumble. Dropping the rear seats is a huge challenge. Clearly the latches are a poor fit.
The gas pedal has an obstruction that can block your foot from moving to the brake pedal. If you have large (human) sized feet, your shoe will likely snag when switching from gas to brake. Seems like a fundamental design flaw.
At least the car still drives at 104,000 miles.",0
The engine sits to low if you pull up to a curb the ac pulley will hit it and end up braking the timing belt I had to buy a junkyard head and rebuild it I don't like how the engine sounds now it was over a year ago other than that a good car,0

"I am no auto tech but over the years I have enjoyed taking on tasks like oil/transaxle/radiator fluid change, brake pads, sensors, etc. A simple oil change took me twice as long to complete. I had a stuck thermostat which took a mechanic over 8 hours to complete. To get to the thermostat 1/2 the engine needs to come apart: upper/lower intake manifold, Air Filter, Radiator. It seems the location of instruments is intentional positioned
to make the car not serviceable. The bumper pulled off due to a cement tire stop in a parking lot ( the bumper has a lip at the bottom that is so low it caught the the top of the tire stop ). The drivers seat sunk down because the cloth tore underneath the cushioning. The alarm trips intermittently, probably because the doors do not close completely. The trunk tends to open on its own and the strereo makes a clicking sound when played quietly.",0

"I bought this car based on my good experience with 2 previous LeSabres. Both of those older cars went well over 200,000 miles with very little repairs needed. This 2004 LeSabre has had multiple very expensive repairs before reaching 140,000 miles. It is on it's third plastic intake manifold, they crack and leak coolant - $400 fix each time. Speedometer failed - $600 fix - turns out there is a recall for this one, but no benefits after the car is a couple of years old. ""Clockspring"" device inside steering column failed, airbag inoperative - $950 fix. Now, a rear wheel bearing has gone out, wheel almost fell off the car - $250 fix.

"I unfortunately purchased this as a used vehicle form a supposed-reliable salesman, on the recommendation of  a doctor my wife used to work with. The prior owners were supposed friends of his, single owners. They were able to hide some major issues with the car to make it salable. The driver's door leaks at the top in a heavy rain, or car wash. This vehicle has major electrical issues. I have had to have the electrical system serviced twice, to the tune of over $500 each time. I cannot stand the auto-lock doors feature, if that is what it's called. It locks itself after about 30 or 45 seconds or so. REGARDLESS of whether your keys are in the ignition. i.e., it will lock you out! I recently had the car shipped from WA state to VA. I TOLD the driver not to leave the key in the car/ignition, due to the lock-out possibility. He forgot, and got locked out, and had to call a locksmith. The sunroof gets stuck in the open position now and then, making me fearful of using it, for the possibility of it staying that way is terrible! Another ""bug"" is the constant CEL coming on. I have been to Advanced Auto twice in the past to investigate the code. All they could say was that it was a generic code for cooling system. It does not specify something specific. I've had the entire coolant system flushed, thermostat replaced; all to just keep getting the same error about once every two weeks. Due to that, I bought a code reader/code clearer from Amazon here. When the light comes on, I use it to clear the code. Inevitably, however, it just comes on again ... and again ... and again. The gas cap release mechanism recently quit working; the cover would not open. I had to pry it open with a screw driver, breaking a small plastic tab in the process. I now have it secured with velcro. The only thing I ""like"" is the sound system. ""Monsoon"". This is actually the best stereo system I ever had in a car. That is the reason for the second star in my rating. I will never buy another VW vehicle.",0

nice car to drive with a lot of nice features. But it turned into a maintenance nightmare. In the shop about every 3 months with something major and expensive.,0
"Great fuel economy. Parts are plentiful and inexpensive. Looks stylish and sporty, but don't be fooled. It's just a practical, econobox.

What I didn't like was that the 5 speed manual is very weak. My transmission left me stranded at 125,000 miles in spite of 30,000 oil changes. 1zz engine from 2003-2005; piston rings get stuck and engine starts burning oil.

In spite of all this, I have fixed these problems myself by swapping in a c60 transmission from an xrs (more durable than the regular c59), rebuilt the engine with new piston rings. I also put in TRD Springs with Tokico blues which firmed up the ride a bit. After 225,000 miles, it can be a money pit, but I'm enjoying my matrix overall.",0

"I bought my GLS TDI in '04, new. The engines and trans in VW's tend to be bullet-proof, if not abused. It gets 45/mpg on the hwy. However the rest of the car is one nit-picking repair after another. I have only 68,000 miles on mine but I've owned other Golf's of various vintage, up to 200K and it always seems to be the same. Here's my list for the '04.
- Sunroof leak. The connection to one of the drains came apart just past warranty. Water stained the roof and side panels and filled various cavities full of water and the car smells like a gym locker room. The drain connection was poorly made, and IMO a problematic design, since it's  a fairly common problem. There is a youtube vid on how to fix. Luckily it was the rear drain not one of the front drains, as access to the fronts is much more involved. Have to remove plastic panels( see plastic below).
- Seat Warmers quit working. I'm lucky since mine just quit working and didn't catch fire as some reportedly did.
- Plastic used on the vehicle gets very brittle in cold temps. If it is 40 deg or below forget about popping out plastic panels. It's kind of like cold chocolate. Plastic is expensive to replace. If you don't have a heated garage, fuggetaboutit.
- Alternator clutch pulley. About a $50 DIY fix(inc purchase of a necessary special tool) but often misdiagnosed variously and expensively as bad alternator, PSteering pump, etc.
- Rear brake calipers. The adjusters quit working from corrosion build up. Parking brake won't completely release, dragging the rear brakes. R&R rear calipers.
- Alarm going off by itself. Apparently, the hatch door gets corrosion in it through the keyhole, eventually causing door ajar light to be on all the time and the alarm to go off occasionally, usually late at night annoying me and the neighbors. Took the rear panel off(plastic - see above) in the cold and fixed by blasting with WD-40 inside the lock and in the mechanism in the door and working the key back and forth. Now, to keep the gremlins away, it's best to use the key to open rear hatch instead of fob remote or the release button in the driver's side door. This appears to work the mechanism enough to keep this issue at bay.
- Hardware. Cheap plastic, screws, bolts, nuts corrode readily adding to repair woes.
- Center arm rest latch. Flimsy and expensive to replace.
- Door Locks. Lock doors and a second later they open, lock ,open, lock, open. Of course I'm in a mall parking lot with stuff in the car. Google searched and it turns out the cause is usually a fuse that burns out. Replaced fuse, good to go, phew.
- Alloy rims. Peeled and bubbled paint, corroded, eye sore. A constant 'source of air leaks at the bead' headache.
- Coolant sensors. Needed to be replaced with a 'new and improved' type.
- BEW eng. Two types of diesels in this year, BEW and ACH. Some BEW engines have an issue with camshaft scoring. I have a BEW but I've not had any symptoms show themselves, yet. Fortunately mine is not one of the fraudulent emission control diesels.
- Soft Suspension. VW, in order to further boost mpg in the diesels, cranked up the tire pressures(42psi on the rears, for instance) necessitating very soft suspension springs to keep you from loosing tooth fillings. Makes for squirrely handling on back country roads and the front suspension can readily bottom out on any undulating roadway, especially with that heavy diesel up front.
 ""FAHRVERGNUGEN: It's what makes a car a Volkswagen"".

For the same money my wife bought a '02 Camry 4 cyl. on which I needed to replace the coolant pump at 30K mi., a known issue for some lucky 4 cyl. Camry owners. Other than that it's been routine maintenance, oil, filters, batteries, 1 serp belt, brakes, tires, R&R fluids, that's it.

"People need to know this is a CAR in the shape of an SUV. This isn't an off-roading vehicle. It's good to see most people are really happy with their Tucsons because I've just about replaced everything on ours in the 3 years we've had it. So maybe we can just say the previous owner did zero maintenance? I've done common things like new wipers, new battery, a couple new tires, a headlight & a tail light, but had to do more extensive things like replaced the fuel pump/filter, all lifters, the water pump, the timing belt, spark plugs and most recently the alternator. A part of the exhaust has broke apart making the thing very noisy (still need to fix that) Now the transmission is slipping. I also think a brake job in in the near future.",0
After warranty expired the paints starts to flake off and parts start to need to be replaced all at once.,0
"The S80 is the best car I have owned.  I purchased it new and the car now has 207,000 miles.  I have done all scheduled maintenance on time and use only synthetic oil.  The car looks and runs great.  All electronics are and have worked fine. The interior is leather and except for the left hip bolster (which shows some wear)  on the driver seat, the interior is perfect.  The car gets 29.0 to 30.1 MPG at 70 mph.",0
"very poor electrical system,  leather seats are worn out. not for diy repair. fuel system poorly designed",0
"Motor is great, frame is so rusted ity isn't even safe. Other than the nasty frame was a great car.",0
"Ok van I did not have the van very long before it's features started to fall apart, for example CD player, DVD player, press buttons to open windows& doors broke, & one string that sucked was there was only one side you could get into the car thru the drivers side only.",0
Wrong part. Was for a malibu classic,0
It was the wrong color. May have even been my fault when ordering but I thought it was white led lights with amber turn signal but it was red.,0
"It started to fall a part at 75,000 miles. I would expect that at 175,000 miles.",0
"Has nothing but abs brake issues.  Have had everything replaced on the brakes and the abs light still won't turn off. Looked up this issue and learned its an ongoing problem with the rendezvous

Also, my 2005, only 114k miles, heads blew. Learned this was an issue as well. The car has NEVER been driven hard either nor has it towed anything",0
"Overall this truck handles well, rides well and is quite capable in snow and light off roading. What ruined an otherwise good vehicle is the absolutely horrible 4.7 engine. I had to have it apart three times in the time I have had it for bad head gaskets and timing chains. I wanted to swap out a weak oil pump but you have to remove the front axle to drop the oil pan. The engine is prone to oil foam and sludge build up and the electric overdrive transmission bucks HARD going into OD.

This could have been a fantastic truck if they had stuck with the tried and true 318/360 engine and 727 torqueflite with a true gear driven transfer case with real low range. I would also go back to the 16 inch wheels so the tires wouldn't be 150 bucks apiece. This truck is unnecesarily expensive, overly complex and therefore too unreliable to be considered for anything but very light use",0
Too many brake problems with this suv.,0
"Perhaps one of the worst vehicles ever built. My truck is 6.0 diesel, and like many owners of the diesel models, it has a very bad history with head gasket problems.",0
"The product was new and as expected however, it did not come with instructions.  I had to look up the instructions from YouTube to install.",0
"Way too many electrical problems. Complete dash lights speedo, tach, all gauges failed at one time. Had brake line completely rust through, almost had a very bad accident because of it. Front wheel hubs on both sides had to be replaced twice. Overall I would probably never purchase another GM product again. I've always owned GM for over 50-yrs. They have let there loyal customers down.",0
"Very small inside and only a small improvement in gas mileage over a full size truck.  I have done all of the maintenance on this truck and timing chain needed changed at 125,000 miles.  Had to pull engine to do a simple job.  What a waste.",0
"No. No. No. Never buy one of these poorly engineered vehicles. You have to disassemble the front end of the car, at the base of the window, to tune it up. A service bulletin warns to install a 6' mastic tape when reassembling the vehicle to prevent water from ruining the onboard computer. The transmission is notorious for failure without warning on vehicles over 125K. The secondary air system, designed allegedly to prevent the exhaust from being toxic is a JOKE! The parts, canisters, pumps, sensors, etc are more expensive than Epipens! Rip off pricing. A general statement from a driver with over 2 million miles driven: minivans are designed to be expensive to maintain when they pass 100K.",0
The 6.0 engine requires a lot of attention !,0
"Comfortable ride, but under-powered and terrible, terrible cornering.",0
"Thread pitch and length were correct however the crush washer could not be crushed. Leaked enormously.
Had to get one at the dealer for a whole $3.50. Works perfect, no leaks.",0
"Issues with Timing chain rattle, oil consumption, plugged up catalytic converters, plastic valve covers that require you to replace the entire valve cover in order to repair tube seal leak. Manual Transmission failure. The car is well received initially, but common problems that are expensive to repair.",0
"If you want a car that will hold the road on long trips this is the car for you.  Gets good gas mileage, has a very comfortable ride.",0
too much trouble specially electrical and electronics conponent. Engine I can say is good but some other wear and tear parts are need to replace place prematurely. Paint on the dash is bubling and cracking.,0
"Unreliable, expensive to maintain, horrible air suspension, way too heavy, poor gas mileage. It's quiet inside, but that's about the only positive thing that I can say about it. It's a real turd from VW.",0
"The car (at-least this model year) is a nice car with reliability issues.  The fit and finish is initially great!  The leather on the seats hold up great!  The paint coding that is on all of the touch surfaces peel and scratch very easily and look bad after a year.  We have had the computer replaced, the drive shaft, the wiring for the head lights start to decay so the headlights needed to be replaced, the headliner needed to be replaced.etc...  Hopefully they have improved these issues on newer models.",0
Its an okay suv. Just a bit hard to work on.  Sold mine because it started leaking oil between the transition and motor. Not somthing i was willing to take on and too expensive to have a macanic do it. Other then that it was a good suv.,0
"Purchased new.  At 75K miles post warranty, confirmed head gasket leak.  I have taken care of my vehicles and my parents vehicles since late 70s.  I have never ever had a head gasket failure from any mfg (Ford, Honda, Toyota, Volvo, Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac...) we've owned.  The OEM gaskets used on these non-turbo EJ252 engine models are of poor quality and have been well documented and plagued Subaru for over a decade.  Not an inexpensive repair either, +$2.0K but I'm holding off repairing.  I did the timing belts myself for about $400.  Both left and right inner CV boots are torn and again very common amongst Subaru.  Again, repaired myself.  Hood latch lock failed and replaced.  Besides the maintenance that needs to be performed in any vehicle, the issues with this car are unprecedented and I consider unacceptable.  Other than that, it's an OK car.",0
Parts are expensive and it is not an easy car to work on.,0
"Nothing else really matters if it does not start and leaves you stranded 500 miles from home. 3 shops in northern Michigan could not fix it and due to Volvo's proprietary software they couldn't even find out what it was. I put it on a trailer and towed it home: $ 740 to pull out dash and put in new ignition switch. Over the 5 years I had it there were multiple big bills. The battery died, which can happen, very expensive. But then it died again after 6 weeks. Car started to smell of burning plastic, made it to dealership: new alternator and battery: $ 1,100. Warranty would not cover battery, as fried by alternator. Many more things are happening. At 110,000 miles it needed $4,800 in fixes, so I traded it in.",0
"It's a smooth ride. If you're a millionaire, lease one of these--brand new--for three years, and then, give it back to them. You will love this car, but don't throw your money away buying one because its trade end value is extremely low. Car lots are afraid of them, and this is with good reason; it costs a fortune to make simple repairs, and quite simply, these cars are not engineered to stand the test of time. Unless you're a top notch mechanic with the ability to reengineer BMW systems in a way that makes repairs inexpensive, a used BMW is definitely NOT the car for you.

All that being said, I've enjoyed mine. I am an engineer, and I see a lot of genius in their work, but at the end of the day, their genius results in a barrage of problems. Below is a list of the most common:
 The adaptive headlights fail at about 80k and have to be replaced at a cost of $3500 each. My car was upgraded to aftermarket LED lights, which to do yourself, will save you three grand, but the resistance changes in the circuit resulting in a barrage of fault notifications at start-up. To fix this, you will have to pirate a copy of BMW's NCS expert coding software, and spend days translating german.
 Per BMW, these cars start out with 0 weight oil. This improves performance, but as parts wear, this results in inadequate lubrication, and oil leaks. Consequently, most higher milage BMWs leak oil, and they run hot due to an overcomplicated cooling system that isn't programmed to contend with the added heat of poorly lubricated worn parts. To prove my point, I dare you to Google: ""BMW fires."" You will be shocked and appalled at how many houses have burned down because of these cars. One contributing factor is that a plastic skid plate covers the entire bottom of the car, allowing oil to build up around the exhaust pipes.
 Another consequence of BMW's low weight oil recommendation is that the camshaft bearings wear ledges that allow oil to slip past in higher milage engines. Since the VANOS valves that control valve timing depend upon upper engine oil pressure, at idle speed, it will have extreme difficulty maintaining valve timing. The engine will sputter, and the check engine light will come on. To fix this right, the bearing ledges will have to be replaced at a cost of about $1600 in aftermarket parts on the intake side and at a cost of a $3500 head for the exhaust side. A simpler and far less expensive fix, is to simply use a heavier weight (more viscus)  oil.
 As far as keeping the cooling system in check, the auxiliary fan commonly fails and is commonly misdiagnosed. Many forums, that start out talking about replacing electric cooling pumps and thermostats, end in the replacement of the aux fan. BMW does not put a temperature gauge in any of their cars because the temp fluctuates in disturbing ways. This a contributing factor to the common oil leaks and fires that late model BMWs are known for. A new fan from BMW costs $700, and an aftermarket fan costs $250. They rely on a temperature switch that closes at 96 degrees Celsius and an oscillating signal from an ECU that controls the fan speed. BMW now recognizes that their higher milage engines typically run too hot, and they recommend replacing the OEM switch with an aftermarket version that tuns the fan on at 84 degrees Celsius. However, most of the forums recommend replacing the OEM aux fan with a $500 dual fan that stays on all of the time regardless of the switch.
 Many of the interior parts will have to be refinished after the car is about 5 years. The chrome plating peels and becomes sharp. The fabric headliner has to be glued back down.
 A couple of personal annoyances are that the passenger side mirror tilts to the ground when you put the car in reverse unless you keep the mirror adjustment switch set to the passenger side, and it takes two pulls of the handle to open the door.",0
"The worst engine I've ever seen. Two large repairs of pistons and rings and other parts in 100,000 Kms.
I will never buy another 525i again",0
When it breaks down it breaks down.. hard to diagnose problem,0
Most parts didn't fit and it says it will fit my car and other parts wasn't what they where as described in the photo,0
Didn't like the fit. You only get what you pay for.,0
Bought the car new in 2005. Had the water pump go out at 25K miles last year and it cost nearly $900 to replace. At 35K the front struts need to be done this year. Can't wait to unload this car.,0
"The  combined Sprinter/Winnebago produced in 2006 was an under designed vehicle  for the weight of everything that the average person will carry.
I think they improved on some of the problems in later models. I have spent thousands on my RV which I should not have had to spend for the
milage I have on it. Will buy a small trailer next time.",0
Its good on gas. Its fast and runs smooth but it has so many eletrical problems,0
Some details and screws were missing. It comes with no bulbs. Also turn signal does not work.,0
"Nice car, runs like a champ but it will live in the mechanics shop soon as it hits 60k miles. My car had close to $30k worth of ""maintenence"" done to it and it STILL had more to be done at the time it was totaled in a hit and run.  I like to think of it as ""Fool's Gold"" :(",0
"I owned a Terraza for several years, which now translates to me as having several years of headache and expensive repairs.  Aside from massive repair work replacing the transmission and the master computer, I was plagued with ongoing issues with the alternator, DVD player, and rear door sensors.  Although superficially it was a great vehicle inside and out (admittedly a bit odd looking), it was a poor purchase.",0
"Pros: has good features including DVD player, decent gas mileage, lots of space, remote start.
Cons: Always had something I was spending money on to fix.",0
Upper control arms went in perfect no adjustment needed bolted perfect as to the rating only 2 stars have not drove it long to see if it is good product yet,0
Very poor on gas millage!!! Other than that it's a nice truck.  Sold it and would not buy another again.,0
"Poorly designed vehicle, lots of little thing have given me wrong. Headlight assemblies are poorly designed and is easily broken.  There is so much to list that I will never purchase a Jaguar again.",0
Didn't work as we did not get the harness with it,0
"Love the design of the vehicle..  room of a van but drives like a car.  Has a lot of bells and whistles, and sensors.  Malfunctioning sensors cause more problems than they are worth.  Front end issues as well..",0
Car is good around town but would not drive long distances. too small and too light,0
I replaced brakes and battery and the brake and battery sensor lights keep coming on. Cheaply made radiator.,0
Never buy this car,0
I have had my navigator for years and the only issue I have had is with the air ride system. I take three stars away for that because Lincoln knows its an issue on several models but will not recall the system to have repairs or replaced with regular shocks. I have spent thousands of dollars trying to maintain the air ride system but just recently decided to go ahead and replace with regular shocks. I was scared but after the work was done it rides the same. So I suggest to anyone who have trouble with air shocks .. don't waste your money fixing it. Replace them immediately.,0
"Not great. Fitment issues. Holes not matching up. ""Is what it is"" situation. Made it work.",0
"The car has 100k miles and I have already replaced steering pump, steering pump hose (leaking, should have been recalled on 4 cylinder too), radiator fan, and ac compressor. My Toyama of 220k haven't given me these problems yet.",0
"Interior is exceptionally well designed for both comfort and driveability. The V6 engine is quiet, dependable and has plenty of power for every driving need. The one area of disappointment has been the transmission: it slams into a lower gear when coasting down hlll to a stop: and when driving in a 20 to 25 mph range (for instance in a school or residential zone) it tends to chatter & buck a little bit. Took it to the dealership on 3 occasions when still under warranty but was told that they could not duplicate the problem. Finally figured how to handle the chatter by letting off the accelerator & coasting through the zone.",0
Engine probs,0
"Worst Car Ive ever bought. 2nd owner. Only put 22k miles on it. Had to replace the left rear bearing twice, the interior is not designed to be in any sort of heat. The rubber coating melts off. Brakes are retarded expensive, clutch maintenance is upwards of $6k at the dealership. Actually any maintenance is going to cost you. Oil changes cant be performed on your own. ALL of the window regulators broke by the time I hit 40k miles. Those are $1k to replace including labor, each. Oh! And lets talk about depreciation. Brand new it was worth $110k. Now, $8k. Not even 10 years later. What a joke. Fuel economy is about 13 mpg and needs 91 octane. Honda Civics run longer, better, and are cheaper. Best part is I took it the the Maserati dealership in San Jose to see if they wanted to buy it back. Know what they offered me? $1k. No freaking joke.",0
"terrible, unreliable. had an 06 had 134000 mi before it died and had to be scrapped. put more work into this car in the 4 years i had it then it was worth.",0
"The vehicle itself turns faulty after the 10 year service its designed for. Air intake filter is not serviceable, AC compressor releases teflon dust onto the system and electric components start having short circuits.",0
"Poor suspension parts and design. Noisy cabin and subpar audio. Cabin illumination lacking in function, wheel we'll prone to rust, subpar seat comfort, basic engine replacement parts overly complicated to replace (example: pcv valve ), inner tire wear on rear due to non adjustable control arm. I could go on....",0
"Its a great direct fit product, but we paid for Saturday delivery and it was delivered Monday.",0
"I have the 4 cylinder.  Not so great.  Have owned a number of Toyotas since my first one in 1978.  All great, except this one

Lots of smaller problems..a/c compressor, alternator, rear suspension issues and corrosion problems esp under the rear bumper.

The big problem was oil burning. 2 quarts in 1200 miles at 110,000 miles.  Toyota did extend the warranty to rebuild this engine.  Now its fine.  I now have 185,000 miles on it.  Im keeping it a few more years

Im ver impressed with the fact that Toyota extended the original factory warranty to cover the bad engine, but the car itself isn't so great

Dont buy one of these used.",0
"This series has lots of issues. All the issues we had were the same as all other owners had, as I learned from various online owners groups. As far as the auto itself: The ride is harsh and uncomfortable for long rides. The steering has a very heavy feel, but not a sporty crisp feel I expect in a BMW. Quality of materials used is poor. All the plastic in the interior creaks and makes noise when going over bumps. I am constantly chasing rattles and other annoying noises. The harsh ride seems to cause many of these issues. All the mirrors and logo badges have started to delaminate. For a well kept and maintained auto, it seems very worn for 70,000mi. Service at the BMW dealer is always a small fortune. As the car gets older it is getting too expensive to keep. Resale value is much less that a Honda or Toyota that cost thousands less when new. Pros: The brakes are good. The engine is adequate and smooth. The x-drive system works well in snow with proper winter tires.",0
Were not made for this car!  Do not fit correctly. Very pretty but don't fit ,0
Bought this to replace the original for my girlfriend.. was not nearly as powerful and twice as loud. After a day she called me and demanded i put the BROKEN one back in,0
I do not like this mini van. This van has been the worse one i have ever drove. You can not park with the front end facing down on a hill. If you do it will say your out of gas and won't start. You then have to push the van till the front end is facing upwards on a hill. Guess thats why they call it uplander cause going down hill your in trouble. Very annoying. The middle seats are very unconfortable specially on long rides. There is no where to hold on to and no arm rest so your just moving all over the place in the middle row. Ive had the alignment fixed 3 times and its still off. Transmission was rebuilt then that failed. I had to purchase a brand new one after the rebuild. I would not recommend this van to anyone even if you have kids.,0
"The truck is a nice truck. But it seems that I got a lemon. I bought it used with 62,000 on it, and over the last 2 years, I have had to replace both heads, a radiator, water pump, motor mount a , sensors going out  repeatedly and now it's in because the transmission is going out. So ya , I give it a 2 stars.",0
"Had to replace front brake pads every 30k miles.  Had to clean power steering resovour screen once a year to stop the power steerinf from wining.  Window controls crapped out at four years for driver side and 5 years on passenger side. At about 1 year from purchase from new all kinds of rattles, squeaks started coming from dash. The deal breaker was at 70k miles the tranny started slipping clanking showing signs of a a majer failure. of course the warranty just played out. On the positive side the ride was smooth and was good for hauling the kids and friends around. Wetraded it in for a 2014 Accord and that has been a rock solid car 35k miles and no problems.",0
"I have had nothing but problems out of my 2007 Dodge Nitro. Bought it used with 103,000 miles in 2017. Since then i have had to replace the water pump, alternator, battery, the AC doesn't work, my door locks quit working and the front floor boards are tiny. I don't like it at all",0
"While I like the look of the Nitro, the reliability isn't all that great.  After 60000 miles, things seem to go downhill fast.  In the last couple of years I've had to replace the transmission cooler, radiator, steering clockspring, alternator, and two days ago I spent a morning replacing both front wheel hub assemblies.  Next, I suspect I'll have to replace both front cv axles.",0
EVERY thing i ordered accept the last item.  Did not fit my car.  ABSOLUTELY love what i receivced,0
The rear floor mat did not fit my car.,0
Never buy any car or SUV with a CVT transmission like this one. That includes almost all Nissan products and JX / QX60 on the Infiniti side. We were on our 3rd CVT transmission with this vehicle and needing a 4th on installed so we traded it.,0
The lights that were sent work well but they did not send the bulb to fit the rear light so a my opinion is not a complete set for replacing interior lights,0
Expensive car to purchase and VERY expensive to maintain!!!  Think twice about owning it out of the warranty period.,0
"Ive had two of these trucks, the first one was stolen right after I had its engine rebuilt. Between the two vehicles, Ive replaced head gaskets and head studs on both. The second one now needs gaskets again and injectors. I have replaced three turbos, three oil coolers, a high pressure oil pump, had a litany of suspension and steering problems, replaced a radiator, water pump, the list goes on. Ford sued international for this terrible engine, but did not make it right with people like me who bought the vehicle. There was a class action lawsuit, but I was not eligible since I had already paid to have the vehicle repaired.

When the trucks run right, they are decent vehicles. They are always on the verge of mechanical failure though, even if maintained meticulously and bulletproofed. Ive spent probably $15,000 just keeping the current truck alive, looks like Ill be spending more soon.",0
The 5.4 is temperamental and way too much engineering,0
"Overall,I like the trk. STRONG motor & excellent transmission. At< 5,000 mi. the sensors for the doors needed replaced.
 Inside light would flicker and click,click,click at every bump,dash showing door ajar. BS. I Had the cross-contamination  @ 77,704. Thank God Nissan extended the warranty 10,000 mi. due to this. Nissan mechanic also said he could barely  hear the timing chain and the've had problems with the tensioners. My hearing isn't so great anymore  (64-too many concerts?)but when I listened closely I could hear it. I do all my own mechanics except what is beyond my capabilities (knowledge,tools,or otherwise)and I know a lot of not good sounds. This was starting to become one. They fixed it all for  free except the $1361.00for the timing kit. Oh,they give you a ""factory"" rebuilt tranny with a one year,12,000 mi warranty
 T hen,@78,564 SES light again. O'Reilly says its the Bank 1 cam sensor. Controls intake valves. It caused #3 cylinder
to misfire which f'd up one (I have 4-2 upstream & 2 down.) of my catalytic converters. Got it from Rock Auto for $178
& about 16 hrs.to install. YOU DO NOT want to do this. I won't again. But I did a week later because Bank 2 cam sensor
was bad. So, after that fiasco,I had to change the other upstream converter. Thought it would be easier since I couldn't
see how it could be any harder. WRONG,WRONG,WRONG! Bank 1 sensor dealer replacement $473.13,Bank 2 cam  sensor was $36.19 & HOURS OF MY LABOR.Less than 29,000 mi later, tic,tic,tic. Not loud,but there. I bought the whole timing kit from Rock Auto. My personal mechanic was going to do the change out the following Sat. I get home from work Fri. & wife tells me my brother died,call Dad. The funeral was on Mon. 1,000 mi away! 16 hr straight there & 16 straight back Rough time. What makes it even rougher was when I got back it was making so much noise,that people around me would be looking confirming my suspicion of a thrown rod. YEP, the timing chain tensioners that the dealership installed were also faulty. I called the dealership & they said that I need to contact Nissan which I did. Basically,I was told ""sorry about your damn luck.""I'm trying to start a class action lawsuit here in Texas. Seems to be a pattern. I had a 2009 motor  put in @ over $5 G's. And I had just had the dealer replace the Bank 1 cam sensor ( 473.13). Then I installed new plugs.  6 weeks later,( I'd bought a code scanner off ebay since then) my SES light came on. G.D.! Now WTF !? I plugged the  scan tool in and it was the lBank 2 cam sensor. I ordered it from Rock Auto & put it in myself. Took about 8 hrs and some ingenuity because they are on the backside near the firewall. Just NO ROOM!! I was thankfull that that was the EASY one.  I wouldn't even screw with ta Bank 1 cam sensor. I Had to replace the front wheel hubs @ around 95K.Why (I know-$$)  did they do away with greasing your own parts. I use all synthetics and could make wheel bearings last 500K.I have a new tube of Amsoil synthetic grease & nothing to grease except yard equipment. There's more,but I'm going to bed.",0
"It's a nice car. Good on gas, roomy and has trunk space to boot. Mine is the 2.5l 4 cylinder engine, the qr25de, so it has no pep to it. It's a smooth ride, but there's no power to the 4 cylinder engine. It's slow, and horrible going up hill. I wish it made like 210 HP instead of 175 HP. That's my only complaint is the lack of power.",0
"Rivals my 1976 Pinto for issues that you wouldn't expect. Rampant problems with electrical system, burns out at least two headlights each year, at a cost of about $50 each. Replacing the exhaust system is about $1500-$2000.  Have had five Subarus over the last 30 years, the last three with alternator issues, intermittent "" Energy vampires ,""  and a dealer network that seems to think we are all a bunch of idiots. Tried to tell them I had an alternator problem, they told me it wasn't possible, a month later had it replaced, and two months after that a recall from Subaru.  Way too many other issues to discuss. Also when they sell leather seats, it's pleather, and it cracks after about 5 years.  When they get back to the ""inexpensive and built to stay that way"" mentality, I'll consider them for another car. As long as they want to sell puppies and love, I'll buy a Honda. I'm buying a car, not a bunch of  warm, fuzzy emotions.",0

Costs a fortune to repair anything in this vehicle!,0
It was great until it reached 6 years. Then it started to rust all over. The engine is horrible.  Ford knows it is bad but won't help those who paid good money for it,0
"Wiring
harness and park brake assemlies bad at 10,000 miles.

Exhaust manifold gaskets bad at 60,000 miles.  Replaced the fuel pump relay 4 times due to location.
Spark plugs break while trying to replace them due to bad design or pay dealership $1500 to change plugs WOW!!! So at 150,000 miles they've never been changed
Everything underneath is rusted badly.
I'll probably never buy another Ford truck.",0
Parts were good but I did not get the promised Wednesday shipping delivery,0
its pickup is very good but all mechanical things like automatic doors and sensors (for tire pressure etc.) are not so good.,0
"The DSG transmission is notchy, causes severe hesitation, and is expensive to maintain. The 2.0T FSI engine burns oil at a rate of greater than 1 quart per thousand miles. The high pressure fuel pump has a cam follower with a flawed flat tappet design that other manufacturers abandoned decades ago; While the cam follower is not a scheduled maintenance item, if it is not checked for wear frequently, it can fail and cause irreparable internal damage to the valvetrain. The turbocharger bypass valve is so badly designed that it is now on its 4th revision for the FSI engine. The direct injection and poorly engineered PCV system cause severe carbon buildup on the valves and restriction in the intake ports that leads to poor performance and fuel economy. All of these problems have arisen after just 50k miles.

If your back seat passenger fails to lower the passenger seat headrest before sliding the seat forward, the headrest can rip the passenger side visor completely off.  If the retractable roof loses its alignment, the only way for the VW dealer to fix it is to replace it, at a quoted price of ~$18,000, 3 times the current value of the car. The seals around the windows have always leaked at the corner where the retractable roof meets the windshield the door window, no amount of conditioner or seal lubricant stops this. The glue that holds the vinyl trim onto the door begins to fail in hot humid climates, exposing the yellow foam insulation below and causing the faux leather trim to shrivel and dry out.  The steering column has bulky trim underneath that is easy to hit your knee on while getting in and out of the car, I have never had that problem in any other vehicle.

The car is cute and fun, if you look any closer than that, you'll be sure to stay far, far away from it.",0
"Neat roof technology, fun to drive, decent MPG. Reliability and maintainability well below average. Engine burns oil at a ridiculous rate. Transmission needed a major overhaul at 20k miles. Definitely get an extended warranty-- you'll need it! Overall I would never recommend VW to anyone.",0
"Took a long distance drive a while back. Enjoyable ride. Bad news is with the 4 cylinder engine off the line is weak, so you put your foot down and all of a sudden your up to 4 grand and not going a lot faster. Not smooth shifting at all. Kids complain about fuel economy. Body parts loose after 7 years.",0
"Uses oil, about one quart per thousand miles, it has been an ongoing problem, never got fixed even when it was one under warranty, key fob issue, would not crank one morning, cost me $350 to get it fixed.",0
"I am a lifetime jeep owner. CJ7,CJ5, grand Cherokee, Cherokee, Comanche, and a patriot. Now disappointed with Jeep. The Patriot is a nice, small, easy jeep but the standards have dropped. My patriot was plagued with front suspension bushing  problems. Replaced several times. Mechanic told me I wasn't the only one. When it can time to replace the Patriot I dug deep in to Jeep standards in hope of buying another, not impressed with the new standard, bought a Subaru Outback. Best car I have ever had",0
"Have had it for less than one year. So far sunroof leaks, air conditioner stopped working, ABS system has stopped working, two headlights have blown, back shocks had to be replaced, front brakes replaced, water pump had to be replaced, all with under 85,000 miles.",0
"Gets me where I'm going but a lot of electrical issues from the throttle sensor going out, to the headlight wiring to uconnect cutting out but still runs so at least there is that ha",0
not the greatest.  honestly overrated.,0
"Cheap quality interior, lots of cracking and a fading",0
"A nice vehicle with a ton of features, but reliability has been a severe issue.  Currently at 100,000 miles and have had to replace the following:
Front wheel hubs, both left and right twice
Brakes, front and rear, 3 times.
Transmission
Rear air ride shocks, twice
Front shocks once
Power steering pump and lines
Exhaust manifold
AC module in dash
DVD system replaced
Front axel right side
Steering column
Again, a very nice car but very expensive to own.  I am sure that several items were unique to my vehicle, but the suspension issues are common and should not be ignored.  I cannot wait to replace it.",0
"This is my personal / work truck and its my second diesel ford van. After the learning curve from the first one, I shut this one down after 80,000 miles and fixed everything that was junk from ford before it left me on the side of the road. Mostly all the parts I used were from Bullet Proof Diesel
to make my truck stout, ARP head studs, Stage 2 Colt Cam, intake snorkle, Jody Tipton 140 horse tune, Garret power max turbo. I'm now considering adding a 150 horse shot. Anyway I'm not happy with Ford and there option packages, can't gett the option I wanted even called was told if I bought 25 of them they would add anything I wanted. Now they don't even make it anymore and the replacement is even worse.
I'm waiting for the Nissan van to be powered with the cummings 5 liter that I can hop up with Banks goodies.",0
"I found out the previous owner had to have the transmission rebuilt before 100k miles, and now I've had to have it rebuilt again for $3k.",0
"Is not what I was expecting  because I thought  it was going to be more padded, but is not.  It just a  thin layer",0
"In our country the temprature reach 50-52 C & the transmittion over heated always & oil should be changed every 32000 km.

The major problem that there is no indicator for transmition oil level or even temprature gauge this causes transmission failure & i hold it up 2 times for 4000 $ even that the car milage now is 160000 km

Other problem that head engine leak the water & mix it with engine oil & the dealer said that its due to putting regular not distilled water alhough i never add regular water !

I put 2 star one for the comfort of the car & the other for safety",0
I have the 2009 VW routan sel within a year of ownership second owner by the way when purchased it only had 86000 miles in the start ran smooth and quiet engine is the 4.0 but after a year of purchase driving to Florida from Georgia no warning no nothing out in drive it shuts off started back on it drove I stop at a red light it shuts off as soon I take off i started again it drove went to a gas station just test if it will do it again well it did a bad torque converter it what the VW dealership to me but that's not only issue in order to replace the torque converter you also must replace intake system completely and ignition system has a recall for it all was replace and engine has never been smooth its loud now I can't wait to finish paying it off.,0
"Lots of room. Poor quality electronics.

Take all that is good about the Chrysler and take it away, except for the stow and go seating in the back.

The middle seats are not removable.
Sometimes it gets stuck starting, others it starts and dies right away.
Sometimes halfway through the day the driver's side doors will no longer respond. The control on the door unlocks all other doors, so it's a cable issue.
This is after having to replace the cabling in the door because the module no longer worked.
There are plenty more issues that I can't even remember.",0
It was great until it started having electrical problems and not cranking or staying cranked.  It actually came to the point that the service manager at the Volkswagen dealship asked  my wife if she knew how to crank a vehicle.  Needless to say that was the point we sold it.,0
Very expensive to fix. Goes through headlights every 6 months. I will not buy another.,0
"I have had this car for over 8 years and seems it has great acceleration/motor/transmission; but the ride/suspension is terrible, too much road noise, gets bit better with new tires.",0
"They have the worse suspension compare to the other cars I had. Rear tires will look like this ""// \\"" if you do not inspect it regularly. Mazda said it is not their fault, just google it then you will find out. I had the shop installed adjustable cambers to balance it out  $500 plus agligment. By 80000 miles the front, rear bushings plus shock and struts start rubbing and making noise, I live in the city not mountain so how these happens all points to cheap build. I forget to mention noise from the stock tires is very bad, replace the tires will get rid of the problem.  Other than those problems the car is average I could have given it 3 stars but the problems mention above just cancel it out. If this car is on your shopping list, take a long test drive and google the problem to see if Mazda has done something to address it.",0
Not what I was expecting from a luxury car. Too many electric glitches.,0
"I owned this car for 2 years and I was so happy when I got rid of it. While it is like a go cart on the off road (meaning it stuck to the dirt like glue and flew around corners) it is not meant for Arizona freeways at all. The MPG is great on this vehicle but all of the money you save on gas you need on repairs. Plus, the transmission over heated every time I went over 70 MPH for more than 10 minutes. It all revolves around the CVT transmission that was a mistake for this vehicle. I am happy to have replaced this vehicle with my Ford Ranger :-)",0
Electronic system sucks... car itself handles well.,0
We puchased it used 3 and 1/2 years ago.  For the first two and 1/2 years it was great.  Now it has been sitting in my garage for the last 4 months needing $4000 in multiple repairs.,0
"Lots of Engineering Problems. Steering Box is Garbage I had problems from the get go and the dealers claim nothing wrong until after the warrantee was up then it had to be replaced. Constant bad wheel bearings on Drivers Side. Front End Poorly Built, had death wobble for first 2 years argued with dealer and had to prove it was a wheel bearing before they replaced it. AC system dampers have problems again, dealer would not fix it until after out of warrantee then $1200 to fix it out of pocket. Overall a nice truck, but poorly designed which is typical for dodges. Fords and Chevy all have their own issues also.",0
"Loved the design, ruggedness and sense of security while owning this vehicle, however, I have recently traded this vehicle due to continuous and repeated mechanical issues.  Most if these issues can be found on various Hummer forums.",0
"Let me start off saying that I am a Chevy fan. I have had Chevy's since the 1960's and while Chevy has had its lemons, for the most part they are dependable and well made. Each model has its quirks and weaknesses but overall they are good cars or trucks. This model however seems to slightly tip the scale to the negative with too many weaknesses, both in design and construction. It has a good look and good power, but the reliability is not so good. To many interlocking systems with weaker parts causing failures, while not individually expensive lead to much repairs over time. I remember the older Chevy's that you could push them hard and work them hard without much maintenance and they where very reliable always starting and being there when needed. The modern Chevy's like this one are intolerant of that treatment and will break if not attended to regularly. This has been the tendency with all modern cars, and that they have become difficult to repair without professional assistance.",0
"I've had three Impalas (2000, 2006 and the current 2010) and all three became basket cases after a few years. From what the dealer told me there is a well known tranny problem that is a costly repair but it was luckily covered under warranty to numerous brake issues from day one as well as burning out the rear window defogger connector cable within a year, all three were the same. The current 2010 one which I maintain well has the check engine light on now for the second time in less than a year, a broken emergency brake cable, a seized rear caliper, a stuck heater actuator so no heat in winter (and another costly repair) and is developing tranny problems again since it's last inspection..

Besides that, it takes forever to get heat or a/c in any of them compared to my other car which quickly

My primary car now is a 2013 Malibu and that car is heaven with no problems at all compared to the Impalas I've owned.",0
"This car is built cheaply...since I purchased it from a dealer I had to replace my dash ($1200) and upper and lower ball joints amd control arms ($1400).  Not to mention the wiper transmission linkage twice, mass air flow sensor, buttons on the auto climate....thats outside the standards repairs of brakes and tires....",0
"Lots defects.  Probably a lemon.  This is the last Mercedes Benz I purchased.  I will not be another mercedes benz owner after I sell the Sl500 and the E550.  I have owned 2 C350, 2 SL500, 1 GL450, 1 E350 and this piece of crap E550.  Bad transmission and suspension system on the SL500, GL450 and the E550.",0
"I have a 2010 528i, and I bought it brand NEW. It has been one thing after another. From break problems, to sun roof leaking and flooding the back seat, To multiple oil leaks .1- oil filter housing leak, 2- valve cover gasket leak, 3-  oil pan gasket  leak and 4- today I find out my transmission is leaking too....
Even though I love BMW's looks,, but I would never buy another one again.",0
"All Mercedes are expensive to repair.  What you don't expect are major expenses at 70K miles.  Items like  a heater fan going out ($500.00) a leaking transmission ($1800.00) and a leaking head gasket (($2K).  Not from a car that is the second car in a house that is only driven occasionally.

Our Toyota has 115K on it, and didn't have one issue other than brakes. tires and normal oil changes.

Lesson learned.",0
Would never buy this SUV again and wouldn't recommend it. I bought this used under the certified Mercedes program and thankfully the first two years my car failures were covered. Have since replaced air compressor which is common failure on this SUV. So as others stated the repair costs are very expensive and not many options for non Mercedes repair shops. My biggest issue is the tire life on this SUV is very low it seems to burn rubber very quick and it's common knowledge within the dealer community. Tried 3 different tire brands and not much success getting more than 20K of mileage and all seasonal tires don't handle very well in snow. I've driven in snow my whole life with many different SUV and never needed snow tires.,0
"Great car if you like expensive maintenance, rear main seal (64k), and water leaks(panoramic roof).  VW not what they used to be.  Was fun to drive though .",0
This car is basically a Chrysler. VW makes great cars but this is not one of them. Lots of cheap and poorly designed craftsmanship. I would not recommend buying unless you are a mechanic or get a great deal.,0
"Although I was very positive-minded looking at this car when I purchased it (tons of awards for the year). I have become very disillusioned to what was likely paid off awards. Everyone knows gas mileage is never quite as claimed, which is okay, but a number of minor and major issues have arose that have convinced me this will be my last Nissan. The interior fabric is not holding up in multiple areas, the worst being in areas that are not used daily. The most prominent is that of the rear interior roof, where the fabric is drooping down. The driver's door has a section that has crushed out of spec, allowing the fabric to pull out and drag right where the arm rest sits. This is due to the cheap lattice of plastic actually backing that section of the door breaking down. Fortunately, engine troubles are mostly constrained to the cheaper rubber used on some gaskets/elbows in the engine bay. Dry rotting within 5 years is pretty rubbish and the part + replacement was going to be over $350 quoted to me by an approved Nissan dealer though. I purchased the part from Amazon and installed it myself, costing roughly $40 and 30 minutes of my time. That same dealer is the one that strongarmed me into paying almost $700 for a spark plug job that, when explained my situation to Nissan directly, was promptly ignored and unaddressed after being hounded for my review for weeks. That same dealer cheerfully told me though that this year of vehicle had so many transmission issues there is a factory extended warranty on the drivetrain/transmission. At this point, I simply hope that if it goes it does so within this warranty period. The AC is also an underperformer though I have had it looked at by multiple technicians who stated it is in spec. So take it as you will, maybe I have a lemon for this year, but Nissan's attitude and their official dealership have soured this relationship beyond my taste for any potential future purchase.",0
"I love the styling of this car, but way too many issues for a car which is only 7 years old.  Most recent issues include a failing AC compressor, a timing belt which appears to have jumped time, and of course the Premium 8 touch-screen radio totally died on me.  Amazing horsepower out of this little 4 cylinder turbo, but I think it's time to move on.",0
Engine air filters,0
"Bought in 2012 and although it's a nice car we've spent tons in repairs.  Back gate motor had to be replaced, the key stopped working and we had to have specialty towing come out because you can't drag them on to a tow truck... they had to take a tire off.  (No it want just a key fob battery, the key went bad.)  Gasket issue that required most of the engine to be taken apart, exhaust issues in the cabin.  The stereo system screen is going out. (See picture).  There was also an issue where the engine brackets were leaking this thick goopy liquid.  Guess it's noise cancelling.  Repair was super expensive.  Oh and the lock sensor on one of the doors is broken. You can't just replace the sensor, entire door panel needs to be replaced which is $1000. ",0
"Our MB was,a certified used vehicle with 14k miles,three years old. It had an accessory belt and tensioner belt installed before we bought it. At 18k miles it needed a thermastat housing due to overheating,a $500 job. At 22k miles the switch module for the ignition needed replacement;strange readings and false check engine alerts,a $1400 job. At 28k miles we traded it for a 4 -cylinder Nissan SUV that runs on regular unleaded and gets at least 30 mpg on a tank of fuel. The MB was,a sweet ride but we were glad we bought a few years worth of extended warranty.",0
Be aware of the 2009-2010 Audi 2.0 motors. That have a piston problem that eats the oil. A thousand miles and half a quart if oil gone.,0
Great car for the money first 100k not a problem. By 140k ABS light stays on and faulters at low speeds. Hard to get inspected in Texas with warning light. No one knows what is wrong to fix it.,0
"Based on my username, you can guess I'm a car guy. I'm also very mechanically inclined, which is good because this car needs attention often.
On my fourth set of coil packs and spark plugs in 66,000 miles.
Trunk latch failed.
Catalytic converter burnt out.
Warranty covered most repairs except last two coil pack failures.
Car is good on gas and I reasonably equipped for the price.
Transmission slips often, and shifts slower than molasses.
Car is overall abysmally slow. Poor handling. I loathe it.",0
This vehicle loses it's value really quickly!!,0
"Look up the leaking head cover gaskets and the recall. It happened 2x, once st 20k and again at 90k. Luckily it's covered under the 100k warranty, otherwise it's a $7000 repair. This car should NEVER BE bought used if you don't have the Hyundai warranty.  Other than that issue, it drives like a Lexus.",0
Ignition coils keep going bad. Other than that not a bad car,0
"junk, multiple expensive problems",0
"This car has had consistent problems. It's not a terrible car, but have had to do a lot of work on it. It also under performs in the 4 cylinder version.",0
"Owning this jeep has not been a  great experience. I would not buy another. Its very basic especially for cost, cheaply made. Has had non stop cooking issues to the point the a/c stops working and any drive over 2 hours during Oklahoma summer causes jeep to overheat and automatically lower rps so you cant srive over 30 mph until it cools. Its literally been a nightmare. Winters are find and it heats ok but theres no vents in back so air circulation doesnt get to back passengers well. Just poorly built thats all...",0
"Its a good size vehicle, not to big not too small. If you have the bigger engine it drives well it the city. highway it struggles, especially uphill.
Its got a lot of cheaply made parts, especially the brakes. At 90,000 its starting to nickel and dime.
I won't be buying another one.",0
This car looks amazing but I have had way to many electrical problems and engine problems to give it a good rating.,0
Back 2 mats are to big .Front mats fit but are not designed for vehicle. Quality is good. Just not designed for vehicle.,0
"Visual appeal and original marketed per gallon mileage.  Comfortable interior and decent storage capacity. Have had major issues with engine over the seven years of owning. All have been covered by warranties or recalls by General Motors. Have had new timing chain, new gaskets, seals, actuator rods, and many other items. Would not recommend buying new or used. Would sell if I was in better financial situation.",0
I have not been a huge fan of this car.  The ride is nice but the gas mileage is not close to stated.  I also had to have transmission rebuilt and new engine at around 70K miles.  It still drives ok at 126K miles but feels like it slips gears at 20 and 50mph.,0
"My mechanic said when this car was built General Motors was in a financial mess and the quality of the car was bad and this POS is not a great car.
I would not buy another equinox , the 4 cylinder motor is too small for a car this size",0
The front edge of the front window vent visors do not fit where it matches up to the side view mirrors,0
Love it,0
"It's well known Ford has issues with paint and the bubbling and peeling that happens to the aluminum parts.  On my lift gate I have polka dots of bare metal.  Other than that it's a great vehicle, but the paint is enough to buy GM for my next vehicle.",0
"Body and interior staying new shape. Mechanical issues from start. This car has always shut off from the start and they can't find the problem. The radiator was replaced. Goes through tires fast. The battery is under the tire well and is expensive to replace. Transmission is awful when you need power. The engine has always skipped. It's the v6 in a crew model.$ 30,000 for this car. I have two fords since 1990 and this dodge has made it clear, never buy a dodge. Ford all the way.",0
Good engine and it's great in bad weather.  Conversely it gets lousy gas mileage and a lot of small plastic parts break have to time,0
"Nice little car, good gas mileage. Downside is the cvt automatic transmission, stay away from it! Google it, lots of people complaining about it. Mine failed and Nissan would not warranty it.",0
The product did not fit my front grill.,0
"It's a dream car, until something goes wrong. Especially after warranty expires, also reliability and oil consumption are major issues.",0
Not quite up to the quality of Japaneese cars...,0
"A well-built and comfortable vehicle that is unfortunately ruined by Toyota's legal department.  You can do virtually NOTHING while the car is in motion, including switching phones, entering or changing addresses in the navigation system, adding radio stations -- you name it.  That said, you can generally get through three or four levels of the system before being denied access to the last thing you need to do.  It is *less safe* to have to pull over to the side of a busy highway to find the next gas station than it is to allow a passenger to enter that same info into the nav system.

Most vehicles have a disclaimer that you can bypass, but not Toyota.  They lock you out, 100%.

On the flip side, you do have to sit through 3 to 5 seconds of the Toyota logo filling up the screen when starting the vehicle before it will show the feed from the backup camera.  So, you can't do anything with the entertainment or nav system while the car is rolling, but they're happy to let you run over the neighbor's kid while jamming the Toyota brand down your throat every. single. time. you start the car.  No thanks.

Absolutely terrible, and we will never buy another Toyota because of it.",0
"Ok for around town, but not a highway vehicle! A lightweight utility at best!",0
"For a compact car, the gas mileage is very disappointing; I average 21 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, and about 23 mpg for a combination of the two. The seats (front and back) are not very comfortable.
The legroom is better than one would think, the air conditioning is cold, and the stereo is pretty good.
I would not buy this car a second time or recommend it to anyone.",0
"This had to be a lemon design year.  The air conditioner is afraid of freezing, so when it is hot in Tucson and you turn on the AC, the car says I am going to freeze and the AC turns off.  Also, it does not handle dirt roads well.  Constantly having emissions issues as it clogs up with dust.  I would never purchase another Hyundai.",0
"This car is decent, but its a pain to work on yourself. Even replacing a headlight is virtually impossible. There are better cars for the same price that can be fixed without spending hundreds of dollars for minor repairs.",0
"Drives and looks great, but is a maintenance nightmare.  Had it for 1.5 years and just sold it.  In that time, I had to get the following replaced: the entire roof ($8.5k), wireharness, pcv valve, 2 speakers, thermostat, start button, seat button, and so on.  Just beware that it will start falling apart around 65k miles and have a big wallet to fix everything.",0

Disapointed in quality of mirror . The power up and down does not work and vibrates when driving . Did not have problem with old mirror,0
"Bought my Jeep Liberty brand new in early 2013. Its good for the snow and carrying cargo. In terms of quality, the interior dashboard panels fit together like a puzzle and pop out due to the sun. Very expensive to maintain especially the tune up and 4x4 differential transfer case service. The tires wear out faster on this type of vehicle. Poor fuel economy and I don't recommend this vehicle for commuting to work. There are better SUVs out there and its a matter of choosing the right one.",0
Has issues,0
Its an ok car for someone who doesnt have kids.,0
I love the 360 viewing. Unfortunately I wasn't informed that the on board Garmin would have to be updated yearly and the cost is ridiculous. It seemed that as soon as the warranty expired the sensors started to go out. I've had to replace several of them. There's one that seems to go out at least yearly. The big tell is my car starts lugging when I stop at a light and try to take off. I have to completely shut my car off wait for a minute then start it back up. As long as I remember to put it in neutral when stopping at a red light then back in drive when it's time to go it'll stay running fine. I regret buying it and will never buy another again. I bought this car new and have replaced the heater blower motor 2times and last year the a.c. compressor went out. I've had this car for 5 yrs now and just made my last pymt. After talking to others who've owned the same car as mine I've personally come to the conclusion that It's going to keep costing me a fortune if I decide to keep my first brand new just finished paying off piece of crap. Think twice before deciding to get one of these.,0
"When you buy a car like this, be prepared to have this problems : backup camera, wheel hub bearing, water leaks in the trunk area, rusted brake calipers pistons, and I still have a long list. Please be caution while you're driving on snow covered roads, I already jumped a small hill. So, my advice, think twice before you buy a Ford Explorer.
Besides that, I really like the shape of the car and all the features it have.",0
"It's hard to separate a poor dealership from poor quality, but these are my observations.  Both rear windows had noisy rattles when raised or lowered.  Three trips to the dealer and one was fixed but the dealer dragged it's heels so I'm still stuck with a very noisy driver side window after the warranty ran out.  Despite driving the vehicle on normal roads, the right front strut failed after the warranty ran out. To replace both struts cost $840 at an independent auto repair business.  The engine still has a rough idle at a stop light - despite two apparent attempts by the dealer to fix the problem while under warranty.  I've owned Toyotas, including 4-Runners for 40 years and had more problems with the Pathfinder than all the Toyotas put together.",0
"Wife loves her Cube. Welds on the exhaust broke at 60K without any impact or abuse (Poor weld quality) and Nissan wouldn't fix it. Also at 65K miles, the top motor mount broke which again Nissan would not cover. These parts should last 100K or longer without issue.",0
"Its a nice car but it doesnt take long to have it sound like and old engine and ive had to change band stuff twi times in 35,000 miles",0
"First of all, I'll state that I keep my vehicles maintained on schedule. Oil changes, transmission fluid, transfer case, etc. And they are done at the Chevy dealership.

My 2012 Captive LTZ is awful.

Pathetic gas mileage.

Numerous times to shop and luckily warranty and extended warranty covered work.

We live in WA state and while on vacation in Canada the transmission failed. Luckily I had Onstar - 100 mile tow to nearest Chevy garage.
Had to leave car in Canada for 10 days and took rental car home (10 hour drive). Had less than 65k miles on it at the time.

Faulty negative battery cable required whole new battery harness.

Body Control Mechanism had to be replaced.

Main engine seal leak - had to be replaced which requires pulling engine out.

Power steering hose leaks - had to be replaced.

Transfer case failure - had to be replaced.

Now the leather seats are cracking.

A/C & Heater system is pathetic. Seems like diverter flaps don't work right which makes it hard to control air temp.

I currently have 99000 miles on it and extended warranty expires at 100k.
I'm not sure if I want to keep it much longer.",0
"Bought this car because I need more space than the Passat. Have only had it for about a year and a half when the problem started. First it was an issue with the steering wheel. Then it had something to do with the brakes. Now to put a cherry on top, the timing belt slipped and I need to have the engine rebuilt. I love the car when its not acting up, but that seems to be more often than not. Will hopefully be trading it in soon. A bit disappointed because this car single handily killed any chance of me ever buying another VW again.",0
"Great car for what it is.  Stylish, comfortable, and fun to drive.

BUT its incredibly unreliable.  The injectors are constantly going, the engine has issues with carbon build up, the engine ""jumped timing"" at 110,000 and required an engine rebuild to the tune of $5,000.  The windows are now starting to act up and not seal after closing the door...I expect to be in the shop every other month with issues. This will be my last Volkswagen and will be replaced as soon as possible!",0
it doesn't meet the floor of toyota prius 2012.but i like its quality.,0
Not happy with quality. Japanese cars are falling down in using plastic material which is cheap.,0
"As a longtime and loyal VW owner, Im sad to say this will be my last. I bought my first in 1994 when the new Cabrio was rolled out. I loved that car and drove it for six years with nary an issue. Sadly, it gave its life to save mine in a very bad wreck.  After that, I made a beeline for the VW dealership and bought another Cabrio. I have a thing for convertibles. It was also problem free. We had to trade it for an Ford Exlorer a few years down the road because life happens. How I missed my Volkswagen!
I finally bought a Jetta SE 2.5 sedan in 2012 and was thrilled to once again have a VW in my garage. Then the problems started. The A/C compressor went out after six months. The ghostly check engine light came on and off. Oil leaks, the fuel pump had to be replaced twice and the headlights/daytime running lights burned out every month like clockwork. Thank God it was still under warranty at that point.
Now that its not, Ive had to replace the compressor again, deal with the monthly burnout, the paint is peeling off the front and rear bumpers and the leather seats are splitting open. The car lurches as Im slowing for a light or a stop sign. There are just a few, but Im so disappointed with my Volkswagen. I wanted to love this car, but sadly for me the love affair is over.
For those who have Jettas that are problem free, Im so glad. Enjoy the ride!",0
Went with the slightly used item. Was wrong floor mats in the box. They were for the Chrysler 300 and dodge charger. Not the challenger had to send back,0
"Poorly made, the trim breaks easily and the road noise is annoying",0
"Transmission issues are common. Things teens to break easily, for instance, the window buttons and the plastic pieces. Seems more plastic than quality materials. The cabin is pretty noisy when driving. And the ride is not as smooth as other vans. I have changed the transmission, the suspension, new tires...it's just not so solid. It holds 7 people and the body is nice looking, that's about the only positive",0
"Always wanted a BMW 7 series car and then I purchased one.  It was coming off a 2 year lease with only 16k miles.  It had depreciated from 105k to approx 54k in that short period of time.  I thought the major depreciation was over.  it continued to depreciate 1k a month over the next 6 months and during that time an article in USA Today rated this car the worst value in its class.  I by that time agreed.  Car performed well, was very comfortable and relaxing to drive in.  Car was an annoyance after driving platinum trucks.  just pulling up to a curb stop could result in 100s in damage because the car sit too low with no option to raise like a Mercedes. Not a fan of run-flat tires vs. a spare.  fun flats typically cost more, wear prematurely, and can you leave you in a bind should you have a blow out.  I'm financially comfortable and purchase cars with cash so its not a case of me getting behind on a car.  its rather regardless of if you have the money, giving it away at this rate was just not worth it for me.",0
"Overall it has been a fairly decent car. However, there is some issue with slipping in the transmission when the car is cold. I had it to the dealer three times for this and they keep telling me there is nothing wrong. I find this very frustrating and the dealership doesn't seem to care enough to figure out why it is doing this.
The van gets good gas mileage on trips. I have gotten up to 32mpg at times.

The space for the rear seats is poor and getting into that section is very difficult. I have had several Dodge vans and it is nowhere near as cramped for accessing the seats in the back of the van.",0
"Looks good, drives great, and gets good mileage, but it has a strong burnt oil smell when the heat/AC fan is on. Have taken it back to dealer several times and they can find nothing wrong. No oil leaks anywhere on the vehicle, they did change the cabin air filter at my request, mechanic said it was very dirty but it didn't stop the smell. The check engine light came on a couple of weeks ago and I had it checked and was told the oil pressure sensor was the problem. I hoped that it was the cause of the smell, and after paying $420.00 to replace the $28.00 it didn't help either. The high cost of replacing the sensor was because the great engineers thought that on the 3.6 V6 it would be a great idea to put it under the intake manifold, instead of on the side of the engine like every vehicle I have ever owned before, and the entire top of the engine had to be removed to unplug it, screw it out , and screw the new one in. Tried to trade it for another vehicle, but of course I'm so upside down on my loan I couldn't see paying $800 a month to trade for a Colorado pickup. So don't pull out in front of me because it is for sale. In researching the 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 3.6V6, after I was told the cost of replacing the oil pressure sensor, I saw several complaints by other owners about the burnt oil smell in their Jeeps.",0
"GMC put the CP4 High pressure fuel pumps in the 2013 GMC Sierra 2500 HD 6.6L Diesels. Pump failed at 135,000 miles. Told by my mechanic that the pump disintegrated. Left metal fragments all through my fuel system. Had to replace all my fuel lines, fuel injectors,drop my fuel tank and clean it out and oh, replace my high pressure fuel pump with the older CP3 pumps, which requires a conversion kit. Also recommend installing a lift pump to help relieve the pressure draw from the high pressure fuel pump to the tank. Now doesnt that sound like some major engineering flaws with the design of this Diesel engine. All to the tune of $10.000.00.  Dealer wanted $12,000.00. I love the truck but Ill never buy another one. Ive found out through online research that this a very common occurrence on these vehicles and GMC doesnt acknowledge any wrong doing. Buyer beware!!!",0

"I have had the car for about 10 months now, and I really like it. I have the 6 speed manual EX model, and it is a fun little car to drive, i also really like the styling of it, and the interior. However Honda's quality has really gone down. A 3 year old car with only 43k miles on it should not break down on the side of the road and have to be towed. I had to have the ECU, PCM, and the wiring harness replaced. On top of that, i didn't have it for a month and a half while honda fixed it. I get it back, and it has a check engine light, now they want to replace the catalytic converter. Maybe I just got a bad one, but it really shows Honda doesnt build cars like they used to.",0
"At 51,000 mi. and 2 years old, the entire engine had to be replaced - $12,000!

For this reason I would not purchase another Audi although this is my second one.",0

"We leased a 2013 ML 350 for 3 years and really enjoyed it.  Very comfortable, lots of room, great in the snow> It had good power, the handling was so-so but we really enjoyed it. When lease was up we saved money and leased a 2015 C 300 4 matic",0
"It's hard to be supportive of this car. It's been a huge let down from bringing it home. I understand there is a premium to pay for technology, but did it really have to come at the expense of quality?

After 3 years of ownership and 30,000 miles, I have lost 20 miles off capacity. This is not enough to get Nissan to replace the battery on warranty. The interior quality is that of the $15k vehicle range.

On good days, I can travel 70 miles when I hit 5.1mpkwh. Unfortunately, I'll have to make do as it is only worth $4,000 on trade.

If you are considering one, I'd highly recommend considering a Hyundai/Kia. You'll get a lot more car and luxury for the money, and the savings on fuel will be negligible.",0

"EDIT:

After two years with minor issues, my Land Rover died in the middle of the road while driving it without any warning with 21,000 miles on it.  I pushed the start button to restart after letting go of the button, the vehicle continued to try to restart multiple times on its own.  At this point it not only would not start, but would not shut off either.  My air conditioner was on and continued to blow, then the battery started to die.  I called Land Rover Roadside and and hour and a half later a tow truck arrived to tow my vehicle.  When he arrived, it started right up but had an indicator light showing there is a problem.  Meanwhile, a nice old man helped me to push it off the road.  The nearest dealership is over an hour away.  When I arrived for a loaner, no loaners were left.  I traded it that day and went back to Toyota.  Everyone I know laughs when I tell them this story and say, ""You got the full Land Rover experience.""  Thankfully, mine was still under warranty and I could bail out before my warranty was up.  I wouldnt recommend this vehicle to anyone who lives far from a dealership.  I also would highly recommend an extended warranty.  Lastly, be forewarned that simple routine services are really expensive, like $130 for a five quart conventional oil change with no other services performed.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

I have had my 2014 Land Rover LR2 for a year and a half now.  I bought it to replace my 2010 Toyota fj Cruiser.  So obviously, Im all about vehicles with off road ability.  The funny thing is that I don't go off roading.  I just want to know that, no matter the weather, my vehicle will get me there.

I had a lot of apprehension going from the reliability factor of a Toyota to the less reliable reputation of the Land Rover.  However, the loyalty of the Land Rover owners I spoke to influenced me to give it a try.  So far, I have not regretted my decision.  READ UPDATE 

I put an average of only 8k miles a year on my vehicles, with an equal mixture of city vs. highway driving.  Im averaging 20.7 mpg.  That number goes up significantly if I take a highway trip.  It's important to note that I can only put premium fuel into my tank, so that needs to be factored in if looking for fuel economy, because the premium fuel is at least 30 cents a gallon more expensive.

This is an excellent entry level Land Rover vehicle for those who can't afford or just don't want to spend the money on the more expensive Land Rover vehicles.  The 2014 LR2 has the same turbo charged engine that they put into the $50k Evoque.  The ""get up and go"" is incredible!  In fact, the first time I test drove it, we all hit our heads on the back rest because I didn't realize that I wouldn't need to give it so much gas!  My favorite thing to do is to give it gas on a steep hill and leave tailgaters in my dust.  It's just really fun to drive.

While I wouldn't compare the ride to a luxury sedan, it doesn't feel like a four wheel drive SUV at all.  You can just tell its a luxury brand by the way it handles corners and drives over bumps.  I don't get that top heavy swaying feel that I got with the fj Cruiser.

The standard leather seats are beautiful, comfortable and are holding up well.  This is the first time I have had heated seats and a heated steering wheel and Im absolutely in love with both of those features.  I would find it hard to be without them.

The model I got does not have the back up camera, which I really miss.  I wish it could be added to my navigation screen.  Which brings me to the navigation,....it's on par with most navigation systems.  Sometimes I just wonder what the heck it was thinking when it takes me the longest route thru the city.  It's best to mapquest trips before you go and kind of co-navigate.

I love the easy touch features on the steering wheel that allow me to answer phone calls (there is voice command as well, but I never use it) and make audio choices.  It has cruise control too, another feature I never use.

The emergency parking brake is an electronic button that I don't ever use due to things I have read about it sticking.

I have had a few recalls, mostly just reprogramming the computer stuff and one sensor go bad that would trip the ""hood open"" indicator on my dash when the hood was fully closed.  The warranty is good to 4 years/48k miles.  After I hit either one of those, I will either trade it or buy an extended warranty.  Most likely, trade it because there are not enough Land Rover dealerships close to me to be comfortable driving an older one.  Repair bills can be costly.  I took it in at 16k miles for an oil change (due every 10k miles, but I don't trust waiting that long on any vehicle), the service advisor quoted me over $500, I laughed and told him to only change the oil, nothing else.  I had a $50 coupon and my standard oil, lube and filter came to $80 (with the coupon)!!  So it would have cost $130 without a coupon.  This same oil change would have cost me $40 at the Toyota dealership without a coupon!!!  Something to consider when looking at a luxury vehicle.

Here are some recommendations if you purchase one:

-Weather Tech floor mats, especially if you have the almond interior.

-Have the driver/passenger windows tinted.  It looks awesome and adds extra UV protection.  I think its a theft deterrent as well, because people cant see what's inside.  Plus, it looks funny with the back seat windows tinted and not the front.  Be sure to stay within legal limits.

-A silicone cover (approx $10 on Amazon) for your remote key fob.  They are expensive and if you drop them they can break.  Plus it adds a bit of water resistance.

One last thing to note is that your insurance will go up.  This is considered a luxury vehicle to insurance companies.  I bought mine at the end of the model year and it was a dealer demo (which means that one of the managers drove it for the first 8k miles), so I was able to buy it for less money than a similarly equipped Ford SUV (Land Rover is owned by Ford).

I dreamed of one day owning a Land Rover, this was affordable and the performance on snow, ice and the few times I have been off road has been outstanding.  I could go on and on about this vehicle, but this review is too long already.  So if you have questions, feel free to just ask, I will try to answer.

Four stars instead of five for this model due to lack of back up camera, onboard garage door remotes, automatic closing rear door, and walk up unlocking doors (I have to push a button on the remote).  If it had all those things, it would be five stars, but then would probably cost me $10k more.  For the price I paid, it is a five star purchase.",0
Less than 2 years old and my motor is gone! There is a back order on the motor so this seems to be an issue for this van. Buyers beware!,0
"Other people say that it's a slow car, they're right, but that's not the biggest issue with this car. I think that it has a very limited view of the road from inside - the seats (especially the passenger seat) are really low and the angle of the windshield is a little off which makes it have a lot of blind spots. The rear window is tiny, making it difficult to back up safely. I regret buying it, should've bought a Honda or a Toyota - that's what you get for trying to save $2000...",0
I have had this car for 6 months. I don't like the seats in it at all. I hate that I am stuck with this car for the next 6+ years. Can I buy new seats for it? Also I have never had a car that had so many blind spots.,0
Built cheaply. Noise from front drive train when hitting a bump. Radio will not play songs from iphone. There is no place to lay the phone. Tires wear out fast.,0
"We loved the car until it started falling apart.  Throttle box, clutch and bearings in transmission have all needed to be replaced and it's not even 5 years old.",0
"Mediocre car
Brakes squeak all the time even after they are replaced
Tires are always low on pressure
Leather is garbage
Driver seat is garbage

Gas mileage is good though.",0
"Hatch strut seems pretty flimsy. Not as rugged as the oem.  It did come with 2 and a screwdriver.  Easy to install, just might not last too long.  We will see.  Price was right",0
"Bought used in the summer of 2016. Transmission was faulty a week after my purchase. Supposedly it needed a firmware upgrade. It's been good in that respect since. Fuses burn out too often(typical of Jeep to have electrical issues, my 98' Grand Cherokee had similar issues). There's no pickup until there's too much pickup. They put a 9 speed transmission in, but it's not in any way a 9 speed. Through the firmware updates they eliminate 1st gear completely, so the vehicle starts in second from a stop. Then, it skips to 4th, 5th, and to 6th. I've never seen it in 7th, 8th, or 9th. So in essence it's a 4 speed vehicle labeled a 9 speed! The door handle fell off, yes you read that correctly.. THE DOOR HANDLE FELL OFF! The lights don't match; Day time runners are led white and the headlights and fog lamps are an ugly off-white. I can replace the bulbs, but why on earth would it be made like this? Didn't anyone look at it and say, ""man that looks like crap""?!? There are definitely things I like about it. It's very comfortable to ride in, the console is awesome too. They want to charge you $15 a month to voicetext and $500 to activate the nav system. Frankly, if it's already installed in the vehicle, there's no reason to charge me. Nickle and Diming is the quickest ways to lose customers. I honestly regret this purchase and will have a hard time ever buying a Jeep again.",0
I like cause they show products i wouldn't find by myself,0
Truck was good in snow and rain no power. When taking. Off small. Inside,0
"Doesn't fit smoothly to truck, when installed doesn't look like it belongs on the vehicle. Install wasn't hard. Will fit vehicle.",0
"It has less than 70,000 miles on the truck and is using 2 quarts of oil between oil changes. Unbelievable that you spend $42,000 and that it uses oil; no smoke or leaks.",0
"I'm disappointed in this mercedes.  I also have a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and am told they are built on the same chassis. I feel that the appointments inside the jeep are nicer. The Visibility and blind spot monitoring are actually better on the Jeep.  In the last four cars I've had, I haven't had any of the issues I've had in this car, and its only 2 years old.  The calipers in the rear went bad, burning only the inside pads, , so ofcourse I had to replace them.  Expensive AMG parts. $1,400..  Ofcourse, not covered under warranty.  Rear Brake light blown.  Problem with passenger door sticking, and not opening. Sadly, I probably won't buy another mercedes.",0
"Loved this truck until the warranty was over. The fuel system is riddled with issues.  Paid nearly $800 to repair a leaky fuel line and a cooler unit from the fuel line cooler and 3 trips to Ford. Now it's the third time at the same dealer to repair the DEF system. Three trips and another $350 (so far) and it's still not fixed. This issue slows you to a maximum speed of 50 mph. Lost time using this vehicle exceeds 4 weeks because it always takes a week for the dealer to have time to even look at it. My last Ford!
I would of been 5 stars and now 2 stars is really too good for this truck now!",0
POS TRUCK HAS 67K MILES ON IT AND SPENDS MORE TIME IN SHOP THAN ON ROAD,0
This is supposed to be Acura's flagship car. Here's what it does well. The interior is roomy and the ride is comfortable. That's where it ends. The electronics are laggy (don't respond as they should in a adequate amount of time ). The Bluetooth is intermittent when connecting to my iPhone 6s. When it does and a second call comes in I go to switch to the other call and it disconnects and goes to private mode. The car does not come with a spare tire. The back seat does not fold down. There's only a small pass through.,0
"Pros: Lots of room for stuff when you fold down the back seats.
Better on the environment.
Fairly inexpensive to maintain.
Sounds like a jet aircraft when decelerating to a stop.
Better soundproofing than older models.
Cons. I expected at least 45 Mpg. Good gas mileage, but less than or the same as my 2007 Prius @ 42 MPG Avg.
Their is no back up camera connected to the dash display like my 2007 Prius, making backing up a significant hassle; this is a major feature that has been eliminated on the 2014 Prius II. This is a newer car heavens sake, I would think things would improve after 7 years.",0
Do not  fit,0
"I have the 2015 Sonata Hybrid with 120000 miles on it by July 2018 - while there are a lot of features for the dollar, the hybrid system has left me stranded twice.  Once at 90k and again at around 110K.  I also had to replace the transmission pressure switch at around 100K.  I will trade it in for something else as soon as I can -  I am in constant fear that it will leave me on the side of the road again.  It's a shame because the car really is nice.  It drives beautifully, the size of the car is comfortable and the gas mileage really shines on long road trips.  We also have a Toyota Camry Hybrid from the same year and while it isn't driven as much, we have yet to experience anything that wasn't routine.  Hyundai has made great strides as an auto manufacturer and I wouldn't be adverse to purchasing another... but I will not buy another Hybrid from them again.",0
"Not a bad car, Good gas mileage. Roomy. Only problem is a noise. Had it to the dealer several times and of course they heard noting. People that have driven with me ask whats the noise. Go figure. Would I buy another Hyundai? Probably not. Due to the experience with the dealership. Ill go back to Honda.",0
Seat covers did not come with instruction on how to install.,0

The good - it can pull anything. The bad - poor quality parts, craftsmanship, and performance. I am embarrassed to say I will no longer buy american cars.",0
"This truck is good for hauling your family, gear, and towing.  We've experienced an annoying ""b"" pillar rattle.  7 trips to the dealership and it's still not fixed.  Very disappointeded",0

"Fit and finish is poor. Terrible throttle response, (cruse control cant maintain speed going up an incline). Suspension bounces like a jack-in-a-box.",0
"Was a company provided vehicle, the newer transit connect was better than the previous version, but due to the cage separating the cab and cargo area, there was inadequate leg room. I wear a 30"" inseam. Also the dash instruments glow day and night with the headlights turned on or not. Not too big an issue for seeing the road as it has daytime running lights, however I was pulled over by highway patrol for no taillights. I wouldn't purchase this vehicle for myself but it is better than the Nissan/Chevy city connect that my current employer provides.",0
"It's a reliable nice car and cheap to buy in used one or second hand.
Are the brand new one from Factory have same price tag like some rivals like Honda Fit, toyota Yaris or Ford Fiesta which are really better cars.
Body roll in Mitsubishi Mirage is just so scary and the ending is super noisy but the only good thing I like about it is super spacious inside and it can be compared to bigger cars like Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic an even maybe big from inside on Ford Focus!
Yeah leg room is great for such a small car like this",0
The car is very slow and has almost no acceleration and is very bad in high wind,0
"When it comes to design I love my S550.  When it comes to comfort I love my S550.  Here are the problems...the car has no spare tire!  You virtually need a tow everytime you get a flat.  They have run flat tires but if you ever drive in the snow you're going to need to replace them.  Also, there is a security glitch with the keyless entry.  We have 2 2015 S 550s and the keyless entry has a glitch, that can't be fixed.",0
Mediocre for my taste.... the key does not fit in my pocket properly and the left tail light keeps going on and off when I am turning.... I give it two stars because it is red and red is my second favorite color.... would drive again if lifted by 3 more inches and wasn't so cheaply made.,0
"This car has been detrimental to my family and relationships... I can no longer tell if people like me for me or for my car.  Although nearly 1000 horse power sounds like a dream come true, my heart power was drained to a 0. No one loves me for me anymore.  So what's the use of having 2 seats with zero friends? It's useless space if you ask me.  However, I gave it an extra star (would be 1 or even zero if they allowed it) because of the very convenient two day shipping... Fastest way to lose your friends and family.  Thanks Amazon.",0
"I've been driving the vehicle for 2 and a half years and have put on nearly 65,000 miles. My main complaints have been with the electronics on the vehicle. With a $75,000 list price it should be at least as reliable as my iPhone; but alas, this has not been so. The most distressing thing is the multiple failure warnings that have occurred multiple times with the vehicle with all the electronic safety systems going off line (chassis stabilization, collision warning/avoidance, pedestrian warning/avoidance, etc.) not to mention problems with the USB port that does not seem able to reliably charge my phone or synchronize with the BMW Connect onboard system. What is interesting is that all this started t malfunction at about the 50,000 mile mark coinciding with the expiration of the warranty. Also, a variety of plastic parts are falling off the interior trim of the vehicle at about the same time.

Mechanically it is a great ride, responsive performance and steering and. very quiet cabin. I would advise leasing or planning to get rid of it in three years or 50,000 miles. If you buy definitely get the extended warranty and hold the service department to it! My previous luxury vehicle was an Infiniti FX45 that only needed gas, oil and tires to go to 100,000 miles and was only sold when I moved overseas or I would still probably be driving it.",0
"I have to say it's a beautifully styled SUV on the outside but falls far short of its design objectives to be a ""luxury SUV"".  Lots of issues in the interior; very uncomfortable seats, digital dash characters are so small there hard to read by us older folks, cheep plastic carpeting, cheep door panels, door controls point away from the driver and can't be read, very noisy interior mostly from the rear hatch.  Exterior fit and finish is poor, misaligned panels etc.  Excellent things, great technology,  awesome radio and excellent performance.  Mine is the Lincoln MKX Reserve with AWD 104a.  Bottom line its a Ford Edge at twice the price.  FYI it uses the Ford Edge platform and drivetrain.",0

I have lot of problem with frame as they get rotten out as rust and mech is excellent,0
"This E-350 S/D is the base for my Gulf Stream BT Cruiser. Ford has a very serious issue with the brakes on this model.  At under 30K the front brakes needed a total replacement. Rotors - Pads, etc. 1K later the left front caliper started to leak and replaced. At 40k the WORST EVER.  It was parked in my driveway (Crystal River, FL.) and I was going to move it and WOW, pedal to the floor.  Pumped again and to the floor.  The left front tire was flowing with brake fluid.  God was on my shoulder.  I cannot even think what would have happened on the road in traffic.  PROBLEM: Behind the wheel on top of the frame is the junction where the lines meet.  The lines to the master are stainless braid to solid steel line. THIS IS THE MAJOR PROBLEM !  At this point the lines are a TOTAL rust out. The lines above and below are O.K.  The reason for the braid line is for any movement between frame and chassis.  Years back you had the steel lines in a coil at the master cyl for this.  The lines had tags with part #,s on them, NOT available from Ford! They tell you they have to be hand made. Are you kidding. How can you make these braid to steel lines!!!  I ripped every thing out from master cyl to the rear wheels and replaced EVERYTHING, hoses, fittings, lines made from copper/nickel and used nyl coil wrap for stone guard. This was done about 10K ago and so far so good.  All Fords I have owned thru the years had brake problems.  Lets not even talk about my '89 Ford Conversion Van. Every trip from Ill. to Fl. was a total replace until I replaced all with HI-Performance parts.  But for the E-350 H/D ????  I told Ford that this chassis is used for School Buses and Ambulance, ETC, but they could care less.  The brakes on this chassis and the E-450 are substandard.  The use of Stainless Steel to Steel has always been a problem even on EGR valves and EX systems.  Driving any E-350 at all ..................make sure the Air Bags work!!!",0
"I expected more for a hybrid, engine and performance wise. The first few months, that car handled and performed very well. Now, a couple of weeks over a year old, Ive noticed a significant drop in performance. The engine runs a little rough for a car thats barely over a year old and the mpg is significantly below expectations. Lets not forget the lack of a spare tire cuz the hybrid battery resides where the spare would normally be.",0
My 6th Subaru and 4th Impreza 5DR hatchback. Still incredibly loud inside and crappy CVT transmission.,0
"I have a 2016 one. It's a lease. Its transmission seems to be built for Sunday drivers or people who will just really take their time getting places.

What I am talking about here is its take off. With this car, you HAVE to wait till other cars go before you can go across streets or make turns off of one road to another where there is traffic. Mine is a lease, and once the lease is done I'm finished with this car. You can literally hit the floor with the accelerator peddle and it will take forever to move the way you want it to or need it to. Not only that, I had the car 1 month and the transmission went on it. They fixed it, but it's a new car. It took a few weeks for them to fix it. That should never have happened. It only had around 1,200 miles to it. Nowhere near having to even have its first oil change. I've gotten used it the take off for now, but I'll never get another one.
Aside from the accelerating and transmission, the car has been fine. I just like to be able to fly from the start when I need to hit the gas. This car will slow you down if you like to do things fast. This thing will age you.

If anyone is thinking of getting this car, I say test drive it, and see what I am talking about for yourself. What you are looking for is it's take off from a complete stop, to lets say 15 to 20 miles an hour. That doesn't seem to be fast speeds right? See how long it takes you to get even to those speeds. Test other cars first. If you test this one only you won't know what I am talking about because of it being a newer car. The transmission in this car, I say, is meant for the old people that are on the road who don't like to move fast in cars anyways and always wait till everyone has passed so he or she can go. pretty much a Sunday driver.

An old person who likes speed, this will kill. This car does not speed up in time for anyone trying to get out of any jam. You were warned.

The reason I say to test it from a complete stop is because that is when you can and will get into an accident with this car if you are not very carefull with it. It's when you think that you have timed the distance between you and any oncoming traffic that is the problem. In any other car, you will make it. In this car, you find out that it does not move like it should the first time you almost get killed because the car did not respond to your peddle movement.

I'm a gamer, I'll put it another way. The lag between the time you pull the trigger or hit the gas, and the time your ammo comes out of your weapon or you start to move, is too great.  Your enemy or oncoming traffic will kill you in no time flat before you had a chance to react to him or her movements. You will only realize this AFTER the first time you try it. By then it's too late, you already own or have leased the car. It is like you have to charge it with your foot for it to go, every time you want to move. It sucks. I will never get another one.",0
"Not impressed. Gave it 2 stars because i like how it looks on my driveway, but it is far too slow, and comes nowhere near my Koenigsegg CCR or even my puny Aston Martin One-77.",0
I like the fact that I bought a new car but it came with alot of issues . I don't like the fact I already had to buy a battery and parts of the sub frame is starting to rust .,0
"I love the comfort of the vehicle. The Limited trim offers many nice options. The downfall is in the gas mileage. I barely get 13 mpg in the city and I drive like a nun. Highway miles are a bit better at around 25 mpg, but still pale in comparison to many other SUVs of the same size.",0
Car is so damn sexy and It drives like butter however boring to drive though.  It does provide plenty of utilty.  Its gas mileage drains the wallet.  Reliable so far.  Toyota I love what you for me.,0
"My wile just had to have a VW Beetle Dune. So after waiting almost a year, our dealer got one, No thanks to VW, what a terrible company VW has become.
My opinion of the car is not good. After paying a premium prince, The Dune does not even come with the lighting package.
They changed the door opening, to where it is much more difficult to enter or exit the car. The seat belts have been moved back to where one has to reach far behind to gram them, and that is with the seat all the way back. The front windshield has been made much smaller, to where it restricts vision.
I am comparing this vehicle to the 2006 Beetle she had previously.
The fit and trim on the DUNE is nice. The infotainment system leave A LOT to be desired. It is clunky and difficult to navigate. There is no GPS service, and the radio is terrible. In AM and FM mode, the antenna does not pick up a clear signal. We are in a large metro area, and had no issues with the previous Beetle.
The number ONE complaint is cabin noise. It is EXTREMELY bad. Just the noise in the cab from the tires is terrible, let alone when in traffic with loud cars and MC's.
I think VW need to fire all the so called engineers and designers and start again with this car.",0
"Lots of little issues with this car. CVT makes strange noises at startup and during acceleration. Subwoofer rattles the rear deck lid and the Honda dealer says its normal. Backup camera lines aren't accurate and dealer says its normal. Front end is very low and scrapes everything. Air vents move around by themselves while parked in the summer. Touring model is missing all sorts of features you would expect in a $26K compact car like homelink, rear vents, auto high beams. Built in navigation isn't very user friendly. It makes me miss my 2009 Civic EX that cost $8K less and had better handling and sound. This will probably be my last Honda.",0
"I have 2016 Hybid Limited bought in used 4month a go with 21,500Miles on it that point.

"We really like the features, the engine is ok and sometimes peppy, the tech stuff is pretty amazing, the size is perfect for us, and the seats are comfortable. Really like the slide-back rear seat for real ""Adult"" legroom!!  2018 seats are harder and shorter seat pan = not as comfortable and the rear seat doesn't slide back either.
BUT, we when drive on slightly deteriorating asphalt roads, the noise that is generated and passed into the cabin sounds like you're in the second seat behind the engines on takeoff at Sky Harbor airport.  Very, very noisy to the point that it is uncomfortable to drive on a long road trip.  Chevy says ""It's normal""",0

"Hello, I'm the original owner of a black 2003 Passat V6 4 motion with automatic trans. It currently has 103k miles. This car has been reliable with only a few repairs: Radiator, HVAC head unit at 5 years, voltage regulator, cam plugs (very easy), passenger side seat heater switch. Maintenance: I had the timing belt, water pump, tensioners, thermostat and serpentine belt replaced at 10 years. I have done all of the other maintenance myself including transmission fluid/ filter, oil changes and differential/ Torsten/ final drive fluids, brake rotors/pads, front right axel (torn boot). The Bentley repair manual is good to have as it explains the maintenance procedures. The car has spent its life outdoors but it still looks great. I wash it by hand only. It has the beige leather interior that does show wear, especially the leather. Much of the interior plastic is rubber coated and has begun peeling, so no matter how much I clean it, it tends to look grungy.",1
A fantastic truck.  I have had no problem with it for many years.  The engine works beautifully and it handles heavy loads easily. I would have given it five stars only if it had a gas tank larger than the present 16 gal capacity. I keep wondering why this model was discontinued!,1
Smooth & quiet ride.  Original tires (Bridgestone Turanza) lasted over 100K miles.  Disappointed that muffler had to be replaced at 80K & a/c compressor went bad at 90K.,1
I really like this car. We bought this car to replace a 2005 Escalade. Only issue is its very expensive on repairs especially if you rely on dealerships.,1

"I been a Ford man my whole life.  My first truck was a 1988 Ford Ranger. Its been Thunderbirds and F series trucks since.  I wanted a large SUV for the family.  Ford didn't really offer something that had what I wanted.  I would of got a Excursion, but Ford stopped making them.  They only way I would buy an older one, is if it was a diesel.  They want way too much for a used diesel.  Being that I have a 2004 F350 diesel and the money I spent to make the engine bullet proof. I didn't want to do that again.  I wanted the SUV to have rear captain chairs. When I went shopping I looked at every SUV out there.  The Chevy Suburban offered everything I was looking for and more.  The LTZ package was awesome.  I did not have to install any aftermarket audio/video devices. It came factory with everything.  One complaint I do have. It consumes oil.  It is due to the V8/V4 mode. When you are on the highway on flat roads. The engine switches to V4 mode to save fuel.  This causes oil to build up and when it kicks back to V8 mode, it has to dump the built up oil through the intake and burn it off in the exhaust system.  There is a little bit more involved but this is what happens in short.  If it was up to me I would remove the engine management system all together.  Other then that I love the truck.",1
"I owned this car for 7 years, between August 2008 and January 2016.  I had the 4 cylinder EX model with a manual transmission.  The EX trim gave it a better suspension for going around curves at higher speeds than the LX or DX trims.  Overall, I was satisfied with the car, and the maintenance costs were more reasonable than with previous Honda Accord models (I previously owned a 91 and 94 Accord EX).  Unfortunately, about 3 years before I sold my car, the dealer told me that my oil pump had a weeping O-ring, and that it would be about $1,200 to fix it.  I decided not to fix it.  The problem got worse with time, and eventually I needed to start adding oil more frequently.  I noticed that higher speeds would aggravate the issue; one time I did a 350 mile road trip on the interstate, and I had to add 4 quarts.  In the end, I sold my vehicle to a new buyer who needed to replace the tires, get the oil leak fixed, and likely replace the clutch.  The radiator and alternator never needed replacement, but the catalytic converter had to be replaced about a year before I sold the car.  The car served me well, and I mainly sold it because I got bored with it after such a long time.  I wanted to spend money on a new car instead of maintaining the old one.",1

"Excellent reliable tough vehicle, EXCEPT for the spark plugs. If you have high mileage and have never changed the plugs, you have a potential nightmare waiting. The plugs will break off, which will most likely result in having to pull the heads. The plugs are rated for 100,000 miles, and most will last much longer.

"Incredible engineering, but almost to the point of over complexity.  Which does lead to more repairs.  For those who can appreciate a well designed vehicle, the VW are hard to beat for the money.  The Japanese designs and engineering are more practicable, while maintaining excellent quality.  For example: Ford still requires dropping out the gas tank to change a simple fuel pump. Toyota, Subaru, Mazda (and VW which is Germen) all have a handy hatch below the back seat to easily reach the pump.  As long as the American Auto MFG's choose the ""get out the door as cheap as possible... who cares a few years down the road... short term profit is more important that long term reliability"", the Asian car companies will continue to take a huge gouge out of the American Car market. People are not stupid when it comes to their cars and reliability!  Wake up Ford and Chrysler!!!  GM seems to trying to hit the mark lately, but they also have a ways to go.  When the bean counters make the quality choices instead of engineers and CEO with pride in their product, they will only capture a small and fleeting part of the car market...

Rear brake pads and rotors from detroit axle great quality and product at a reasonable price,1
"Good car, just the right size, and really no problems after 6+ years and 160,000+ miles.
The weakest points for it have been the window motors. I have replaced all four now with the upgraded versions (thanks, YouTube!).
Strongest points is that it is great in the snow, warms up fast, and with the back seats down, it can carry a lot of stuff (moved twice since owning it, and everything went in and out no problem).
Mileage isn't great, but it's a Jeep and they aren't known as being fuel efficient. It's got a 6-cylinder engine, which is part of the reason for that -- but it's a strong engine.  I've used the car to drag some fallen trees out if the yard, and it's handled it easily.
i would get another without hesitation.",1
I love this jeep. Only thing I don't like is the $$$$$ cost of jeep mods and accessories.,1
"While its different in appearance, its still a Jeep and doesnt have the cookie cutter look that most crossovers have. Its a well thought out vehicle, fun to drive. The 2.4 Tigershark engine provides plenty of horsepower, and the 9 speed transmission seems much better shifting wise than past years. The one thing I didn't like is how the wheels are tucked in, making it look like its on roller skates, so I got the rugged ridge wheel spacers, giving it a much better stance, maybe even slightly better handling.",1
"The sun visors are just there for decoration- they're not big enough for to do any ""sun visoring"".

Overall, truck pulls the loads with ease.",1
"Decent driving ZX-3 with SV components, front wheel drive automatic with cruise control and add-in of 30-pin IPOD connector adapter to existing radio; 2nd add-in is POLK speakers.  Last few years I've used Sumitimo tires which were okay. Adjustable steering wheel and remote side mirrors make the car a nice package. Except for the 4 months it tried to kill me. Turned out the fuel pump at 110K was starting to fail; only during high speed tight turns would the engine lose power, typically in front of a semi. leaving me to ""fall"" back towards the other vehicle without my brake lights coming on so they wouldn't have known except for my rapid closing distance that I was about to stop in front of them. turns out there was a limited time recall on certain vin number vehicles for pump replacement; 1 - my vin wasn't in the recall and 2 - I got 110k miles a few years outside the recall interval. Cost me 973.00 to get 2nd generation fuel pump and get it installed (drop tank, break out the old pump, prep surface and install new pump, reinstall tank). Old pump was starting to deform or the reservoir around it wasn't hold fuel during turns. Now it runs great and is reliable agian. Except for the headlights going out randomly. Turns out the molex connector to the headlight module was made with bad pin sockets; rather than buy a new wiring harness just to replace a socket I used a right angle pick to lift the individual metal fingers upward enough to make a more substantial contact against the module's pins. Hasn't failed in a year now where it used to stop every few months as vibration would cause separation of the contacts. At 150.00 each it was an expensive learning plan only made obvious after I noticed contact burn building up on one contact. Now its reliable at night too. Except for the right angle pcv return tube located between the firewall and the back of the engine that is made of such soft rubber it collapses into itself pinching off the pcv tube. Had to replace that with the improved elbow that won't pinch itself off because someone didn't do the thermal analysis on modules of elastic yield and the heat developed by a engine block 1 inch away from a line with negative pressure. The trick about using a tubing collar around the bad tube to prevent collapse will buy you a few months though.",1
"Very simple and extremely reliable car. No bells and whistles, very good for beginners who need to learn how to ""feel"" the car without electronic helpers.

"It is spacious and drives like a car rather than a truck. It can carry 8 passengers comfortably and with the rear sets out/folded, provides a large cargo space. The 4 wheel drive is a boon in winter when our local roads remain unplowed. ours only has 56,000 miles on it. We miss the rear camera and all the USB connections etc that our newer vehicles have but for what we need it for, this Sequoia has been more than adequate,",1
Great truck to tow with. However the gas mileage could be better.,1
"poor gas mileage compared to Toyota, Ford, and GM but very dependable.",1
Purchased this auto for little to no money. Fixed the minor issues and it has been driven daily for almost a year without fail. The ride and handling are wonderful for a 22 year old auto and people never believe how old it is... Great car if you can work on them yourself.,1
Overall the truck is nice. A few complaints. When I fill my truck up the gas tank whistles loudly as I fill it. The dealer tells me it's normal and there is no fix. My front bumper was installed crooked from the factory. The bed of the truck is extremely weak metal. I tried putting some light duty lumber racks on and the fenders would flex with light side pressure using my hands to push left and right on the top of the racks. So I took the racks off. The front of the bed has permanently bowed on my truck from putting 3 sheets of plywood in the bed and lightly hitting the front of the bed as I put them in. This thing is literally made like a tin can. The 4-wheel drive system is more like a 2-wheel drive system. In four wheel drive only one rear tire and one front tire will spin. At no point will 3 or 4 tires get traction and spin. As the truck shifts through all the gears it's not nearly as smooth as a Chevy transmission. The engine has no power below 3k-4k RPM. After 4k it has lots of power. I think this is why it doesn't shift very well. It has no low end torque. It's a very fast truck though. Faster than any Chevy I've ever had.,1
Everything is good,1
Excellent  vehicle silky smooth engine performance and plenty of power on regular gas,1
"Well, Amazon is inviting me to rate this car, and, well, I hate to say no.

I don't want to bore anyone with technical recitations.  For me it's not about the numbers on the paper, it's about how the car drives, how it feels, and how it fits into your life.  Certainly I'm no stranger to the German Four Door Sport Sedan life - I did enjoy driving a BMW 330i in my younger days - but there's something about Mercedes that, well, is more sedate.  Elegant.  Confident, maybe.

We've all had, or known someone who has had, a crazy overly-attached girlfriend.  You know, the kind who has to call you every two minutes to talk to you, has to be in your grill all the time, who may be high energy bordering on frenetic.  Well, the BMW is kind of like that girlfriend.  You know, often painfully, what your status is with the BMW at all times.  If you run over a beetle on the road, your BMW Crazy Girlfriend will tell you all about it.  And for some, that kind of, I dunno, ""connectedness"" is seductive, desirable even.

But then we have the C300.  It's not hyper.  It's regal.  It's not interested in telling you all about every single little detail of every single little thing in your driving experience.  It handles things for you, often behind the scenes, and only bugs you for the important stuff.  So while the BMW is overly communicative, the Mercedes exudes more of an air of ""hey, honey...don't stress about it.  I got this.""

For day to day driving this is actually a good thing, but, well, it isn't always welcome.  Take acceleration.  The BMW was always quick to jump into action.  The Mercedes, on the other hand, well...here.  You push down the gas pedal and there's a pause while the Mercedes decides if you're really serious.  Then you get the sense of a Teutonic butler coming into the room and saying ""here is the speed you requested, sir"" and you take off with a rather aristocratic push to the kidneys.  Even in Sport Mode, you still get a bit of lag off the line.  This is attributable to a, well, rather vague slushbox that just doesn't like initial extreme inputs.  This is something that has, I think, plagued Mercedes over the years.  Nice car, weird transmission.

I will say that with the 2011 model year, I think Mercedes finally got it's quality assurance issues under control.  The car is made well, certainly better than the prior generation that sent me to BMW in the first place.  No rattle, the car feels sure footed, and of course you get that vault-like thump when you close the door.

In terms of interior styling, well, I think it's trying a bit too hard.  Mine has black interior with brown wood trim on a Sport model.  Black with brown trim just looks...weird, I guess.  And it's a sport, so I'd think aluminum trim would be a better choice, but that's not something I was given.  It follows the typical seating arrangements of these sport sedans, in that rear seat legroom is a bad joke depending on who is sitting there - adults are going to be minorly annoyed to majorly angry, and the middle back seat (despite a headrest there) is suitable only for young children.

Nits aside, I do confess that when I think about this car I tend to smile.  It does have that aristocratic bent to it that makes you feel more serene, more regal.  It drives well and is sure footed when doing the canyon carving thing, but it works well around town too.  It is, for me, a good daily driver/weekend fun mobile.  I do wish the transmission were more responsive, and that's the single biggest issue I have with the car.  Aside from that, I'm very happy with it.",1
"I have a 2000 VW TDI Jetta. So I've been driving it for 17+ years (bought it new in October '99). It's more than paid for itself by now. It's a manual transmission diesel, which has plenty of pep (torque) off the line and handles pretty well. I only have 160k miles on it, if maintained it will probably last another 150k or so. If I want to keep sinking money into repairs.

I fill the tank once a month. I love driving it, but it is starting to show it's age, and little things are falling apart, like the cup holders, the auto mirror control, the headliner is sagging, the moonroof won't open, I'm started getting electric problems, the MAF (mass air flow sensor fails very often) which throws a check engine light warning. I keep a spare MAF in my trunk in case the car gets crippled by the MAF. VW to try to meet emissions has some crazy engineering to recycle oily air (MAF) which gets clogged up and creates all kinds of problems. The newly designed timing belt needs to be replaced every 100k miles, which is costly but infrequent.

Overall I really enjoy driving the car, but dread when it breaks. I wish the dealerships maintence department were better.. which is my main complaint about VW.

VW dealership repairs are really expensive so I try to avoid them at all cost. I also don't trust them at all.",1
"This is my 3rd Dakota and I like the size and comfort. I only use it for light duty like fishing and around town. I would give it 5 stars however, it only gets 15 mpg ever since I have owned it. Very seldom using 4 wd so I guess it's the truck. Any suggestions?",1
"Very simply, I love it. Most cars today will be fast, even sedans will handle pretty well. The questions you must ask yourself are ..... is it fun to drive? ... what do i feel when I look at the lines of its design? ... does it speak to me? And safety..... i suppose...

I test drove many cars and versions of cars before getting this one. Had been a fan of Mustangs for ... well .... many years.

The v6 is quick, 300 horses. Still, them horses got a lot of weight to pull. So quick, but for the road, not a drag strip. Expect a little understeer, but pressure that gas and the back will slide a little and complete the corner for you. Traction is pretty good. The car feels predictable and I can confidently manuver it even at high rev. At low rev, she is well behaved, however, at higher rev, she will misbehave.
 I usually turn traction off. For me, the car corrects while I am correcting and it just ain't comfortable.

The interior is good. It won't blow you away with flashiness, but I still feel at home. Visibility is less than optimal, but i got used to it.

Yes, the baby car seat will fit, but ... expect the front passenger to suffer.

Also, reaonable trunk space. Holds one normal suitcase and some small bags. The back seats will not be comfortable for an adult.

The GT version 435 horses. Test drove this one a couple times. Feels overpowered ... i mean that in the best way possible. Thrilling actually. If you don't drive it right, it will definately toss you around. Slight styling tweeks... vented hood, for example. And the sound of that v8. Like music. The rumble ... you will feel it.

All in all, what this car gives for the money, pretty good. But there are a few areas I would improve. Maybe with some options another customer may overcome my issues.",1

Problems: Engine computer (ECU) developed a short at 5000 miles causing the engine to run on 7 cylinders, various fluid leaks after a couple years of ownership (engine oil, transfer case, differentials), door lock actuators needed replacing under warranty, A/C compressor seized around 190K miles, radiator developed a major leak around 210K miles, belt tensioner pulley started to fail around 220K miles, radio seems to have short-term memory loss for presets.

Other observations and opinions: Transmission too reluctant to downshift (requires a very heavy foot or use the OD OFF button), brakes are weak and require a good amount of pedal pressure to stop, cargo space is famously small due to spare tire mounted inside, leather quality is low but holding up (vinyl seat surfaces are tearing though), steering lacks any feel or feedback (old-fashion recirculating ball).

So why give my Grand Cherokee 4 out of 5 stars with these problems and observations? Because I didn't expect it to make it farther than 100K miles (also didn't expect to still be driving it after 22 years). Its also taken the family on many memorable road trips without any issues. Its been off road on trails requiring low range and its pushed its way though heavy Sierra Nevada snow storms without issues. Sure its had its problems but it has also exceeded our expectations while being enjoyable to drive (relatively speaking). Its by no means advanced and lacks the refine,ent of todays SUVs but I don't think many of todays SUVs can go where my Grand Cherokee can.",1
I've owned the tZ71 Colorado for a year. My only complaint is the comfort of the seats which I start to really notice after about an hour of driving. The truck runs great and I get about 23 mpg.,1
"02 Bumblebee yellow dodge neon. Must have been in a wreck because the fenders are now a dark blue. This car was running terrible when i bought it and wouldn't even shift above 45 mph. Also screeched terribly the faster you drove. After a new oil pan, a new set of back brakes, 2 new tires and some basic maintence this $400 car now shifts well, the screeching is gone and handles like a dream. Just needs a couple more tires and a tranny service along with a new thermostat and 02 sensor to run like a dream. I am very impressed that despite my delay in the needed repairs this car has kept running without fail. In the previous fords i have run this car would not even be moving or as reliable as it has been. I will definitely be sticking with neon's for a long while.",1
Solid well built. Gas mileage not great. But the cost was very low. Good truck,1
"I have always been a Ford guy.  My first car at age16 was a old beat up F150.  I have had Ford trucks eversense,  I am now in my 50s.  As soon as I saw this GMC on the lot I knew that it was the truck for me and I could not happier.",1
"Solid, excellent riding car that gets in excess of 26 mpg on the open road. For the home mechanic, pretty easy to work on. The biggest repair was replacing the window motors, a recurring issue. Otherwise maintenance has been low.",1
Truck has a wide turning radius that makes it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces and back up camera is odd & can cause you to sideswipe an object in blind spot. Otherwise it's a great vehicle and looks and drives very nice. Too early to tell about long term quality.,1
"I love my buick it rides so nice and quiet leather interior and parts are still around and the Garage helps with that immensely. Since its the last of the large cars it gets much attention from the public so I like to keep it nice, it has been my daily driver but now its in the fix up mode and getting it ready for the summer beach runs with family and dogs. Keep the old steel on the road master lol",1
"Have over 106,000 miles on it and have not had to do much more than normal maintenance. Did have to replace front spindles at 96,000 miles.",1
Great,1
"nice car good gas mileage at 165,000 miles only a timing belt , thats cheep",1
Would have 5 stars if it wasn't for the terrible sync entertainment system.,1
"Great car...rides good.  Gas mileage is a little weak and the suspension creaks but overall a very good vehicle.  We totaled our old one and got this as a replacement, so this is our second time around with Lexus.",1
"I've only owned the '04 Envoy for about 6 months.  I am the 3rd owner, but the car only had 67K on it (which is why I bought it).  I've owned 3 Ford Explorers before the Envoy, but this is a whole different vehicle - not that I have any issues with the Explorer.  It is an ideal vehicle (at least it was until Ford decided not to make the tailgate opening wide enough for 48"" wide sheet goods).  The Explorers were built to work, and they did a fine job, but the Envoy rides like and reminds me a lot of my '05 Cadillac CTS.  The electronics are very similar, and both the ride and looks are a step above what I had been driving.  It handles my utility trailer and a car full of tools with no issues too.

I've only put on 3K since owning it, but just returned from a 900 mile trip with 4 adults and a 3-year old in a car seat.  The trip was comfortable, plenty of room for luggage.  The ride was smooth and I averaged over 24 mpg on the trip - I am very pleased.",1
"Although they are prone to a few specific issues such as leaking air conditioning and failed panoramic roof panels, it's one of very few suv's that are fun to drive. Handling is very good and comfortable, and the all wheel drive is excellent. Keep up on maintenance and it will last a long time.",1
"It's is driven mostly by my wife, but it has a decent ride and I like driving it as well.  Plenty of room and not too bad on fuel either.",1
"Strong, good looking, comfortable. Would give it 5 stars but it doesn't turn worth a damn. I still love it!",1
Almost as good as a Toyota Tundra and that is saying a lot. The dealers really like to charge for services!! I would buy another Ford truck.,1
"I bought my 1995 Areostar XL in 2003 for about $3,500 and drove it to work and back a night, and my daughter drove it to collage during the day, Never left me on the side of the road except when t he Water pump failed` very comfortable and reliable. I am a mechanic, I replaced water pump, control arm bushings, heater hoses, brakes and the battery. I had to redo the side door track, it broke loose several times. The only thing I dis-liked was that the A/C system blocked access to the heater core on the firewall. You would have to open the A/C system to replace the heater core. In Dec 2 008 I purchased a nice midsized 4 dr 4 wheel drive pickup. I ended up selling the Areostar for just $300 to get it out of the driveway. I had just redone the front suspension",1
"My wife bought hers new of the lot.  The truck had about 35k by the time we met but as far as i know there weren't any issues before then.  It now has 210k and has been very reliable (knock on wood).

Pros:
- plenty of power with the hemi, this may be a con if you acquire a lot of tickets.
- very easy to work on.  Some sensors and stuff are hidden like everybody else but overall it's pretty straight forward.
-honestly did nothing but maintenance until 200k.  This truck was not babied at all.  It has a gooseneck installed and has carried way more then the suspension was rated for.
-major repairs have all been done between 200 and 208k (current reading).  Entire cooling system.  Water pump went out (it was an oreillys one because i lied and did change the factory one out at about 100k) and ikept putting it off as it was just a bad gasket.  I kept adding tap water which is very hard here and the radiator started leaking.  My fault not Dodges.  Valve cover gasket started leaking at about 200k.  Oh yeah at about 150k i to replace both front wheel bearing assemblies.  A/C blows ice cold even during 110 degree summer days in Texas.

Cons:
My biggest issue with the truck is the cabin space.  It's a full size pickup but i feel like I'm sitting in a Dakota/ranger/s-10.  If you are a full size adult you will feel cramped in the back seat.  When my sons car seat was rear facing behind passenger seat) i had a difficult time sitting in the passenger seat and I'm only 5'10"".  Better cabin space and i would give this truck 5 stars all day long.

Overall it's a great truck.  If i had to buy it again i would based on my experience but would get the 4wd option.  But i honestly have no use for another ""half ton"" pickup and wouldn't buy it again.  That is based solely of my needs in a truck with all the towing and hauling i do, not the quality or performance of the truck.",1
Lots of after market goodies ,1
Reliable,1
all good but transmission,1

"Just got new 2017 Chevy 1500 custom 2wd 5.3 double cab standard bed and it was an upgrade from my 2005 GMC Sierra SLT z71 extended cab, u can feel the subtle differences but gmc drove like nothing was in the way but the Chevy drove feeling like the fuel management system was kicking in push it from v4-v8 you can feel it sometime when u drive slow... but I do love the led head light grill and the tight suspension and looking forward to customizing it...",1
"This is like a merger of a 55 Ford, with a space shuttle.  The design is very dated but it has many attributes which are, or were, unique when it came out. I do my own work. Some things are complex(heater house runs beneath the intake plenum), while other tasks are relatively easy (water pump or thermostat).

Experience has driven me to get premium brakes and slotted drilled rotors.  Many inexpensive aftermarket rotors available today will warp quickly. I had an S type that was more fun to drive, but this model was aimed at a different driver.

Down side - It has a small and shallow trunk.",1
Great product for the price. They fit correctly and work well.,1
"its an okay car, I like it.",1
Reliable and smooth driving.,1
I have been using these hubs to replace thee stock hubs. Work very good. Better than stock since they are manual locking.,1
Very nice truck. 5.3 has good power with decent mileage. No major issues except rusty rocker panels and cab corners. If I could order 2002 GMC Sierra 1500 Z71 new I would,1
"luv the cover..just slightly larger..wish they would make one a little smaller, but very nice indeed",1
Bumper and brackets fit perfect on 98 Toyota Tacoma. Use original bolts. Impact wrench twisted one of the bolt head off of one supplied with bumper. Impact was not set on strongest setting.,1
"It's a great car, feels solid on the road, the quattro is awesome, especially on wet roads.
Gas/milage is reasonable, reliable if you do the maintenance as required.
I commute this car every day via traffic and it's comfortable when sitting long period of time and also agile and fun to drive on open roads.
Maintenance can be pricy if you go to the dealer but there are many great independent shops that do better job with better prices.
This is my 3rd audi in the US, had this one for a year and very happy with it. (got in an accident with my previous one, would still had it if wasn't total loss).
Not 5 starts since it's getting old technology wise and it's missing some of the features that new models have.",1
"Not a bad car; but.... very expensive to fix. Even has a lotta Well-known issues that I believe should have been done under recalls like Fuel tank Sending unit, Cruz control, The fuel tank itself, Those are some of the common problems you hear about the most  but are not not a bad car .",1
car good but paint not worth a dam peeling  i have 2 both have same dam problem. john,1
I am a big chavy fan I get decent gas mileage not like the S10 but for little things it does great so if you like trucks but no need for a full size truck this is great,1
Seventeen years later and my 4x4 Tahoe still runs and looks GREAT!,1
Happy it works good with my truck Toyota Sequoia 2002,1
"The car rides really nice, good pick up for a 4 cyl.  the only thing is it does not block out the outside noise.",1
"Admittedly my 'old' ride(1989 Toyota SR-5 pickup)is a far cry from this sweet ride but I've driven(owned)a wide array from a 1969 Toyota Land Cruiser(leaked in winter both water and air, stifling in summer, noisy, rough, choppy like riding in a beer can but loved every moment!)or my 1979 Porsche' 924(actually a mildly tuned 2 liter Audi w/updated chassis). Sure it's a touchy brake/throttle wise but it's a pretty sweet ride. Brakes and acceleration asks and delivers within the 1.8l turbo/brake capabilities . One thing though, if you have to swap, for example, lighting interior or exterior, it has a different pairs of bulbs for everything! The heat/AC is pitiful at first but they're adequate, barely. Glorious seats; firm and inviting and no switches on the steering wheel just a horn button. Simple stalks for light control(left)and wipers(up/down)is super intuitive even without the poorly written and sparse 'user manual I'm pleased so far.",1
"I bought a 2010 2.4, 4 cylinder with 90k miles on. It was in mint condition, very smooth ride. It is now with 104k miles on.
The problems it had so far:
-power steering basically stopped working, so the whole system was replaced by the dealer and it has been great since;
-it has a weird vibration around 20mph while accelerating. Several mechanics took a look, multiple suspension and drivetrain parts were replaced including all cv joints and right/left axis and nothing solved. Tires were balanced, rebalanced, rotated, and still nothing solved it so I am living with that annoying shaking.

Cons:
-fuel consumption is not so great. Road 22MPG, City 12-15MPG.

Pros:
-super low price for a good car and low+low priced maintenance.",1
Bad brakes. Replaced at 12000. Needed another replacement at 45000.,1

"This was a nice car! Best part is no one is looking for a Saturn Aura!! They all want Honda, Toyota... So you can buy these cheap! I think it's better... Great ride, nice features, a lot of car for the money. I'd still have mine but a truck hit it!! ",1
The start of something good,1
Definitely a car that needs work but awesome to drive with top down,1
"The one constant I am noticing with this vehicle, is the transmission giving out right around 120 to 130,000 miles.  The problem is in the fact that the 4L30E transmission it is fitted with has no dip stick, and if you want to check your transmission fluid, you need to crawl under the vehicle to do so.  I believe that a lot of people neglect their transmissions due to this factor.  Another issue, would be that these transmissions are very rare to find, and you would need to either rebuild it yourself, or pay a tidy sum to have it rebuilt at a garage.  I was lucky enough to find a used one out of an Isuzu Rodeo with a blown motor.  If it hasn't been wrecked, or has a blown motor, beware of what you are getting.  I am putting in new seals, and all of the solenoids, as a precautionary measure, before installing this used transmission.  I hope this actually helps you out.  Thank you, Eliot A.",1
"The review is for the 2010 F150 Lariat 5.4 l Triton. The original Pirelli tires were gone around 40K miles with regular maintenance and light daily use of the truck. Sync and car health report feature(s) are badly implemented and painful to work with. The cream colored leather seats started showing signs of wear around 45K and weren't covered under the extended warranty (neither was the costly spark plug change at 60K which was supposed to be included in the originally purchased extended warranty/service plan.) Original air filter is placed low in the engine compartment and sucks up street dirt rather nicely - which was replaced by a washable/reusable -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airaid-401-226-SynthaMax-Dry-Filter-Intake-System/dp/B004IARGT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airaid 401-226 SynthaMax Dry Filter Intake System</a>
Mud flaps were dealer installed all around to keep paint damage and surface spray to a minimum. The tranny bucks when shifting from park into drive and has done this from early on. The Chevy Silverado shifts much nicer. With moderate load it gets 19mpg hwy on the new Michelin tires. City driving with frequent stop and go is typically not better than 15mpg.  In comparison to the lighter 2015 model its sits on the road sturdier and less susceptible to side winds.",1
"I laughed at the opportunity to rate my '99 Grand Caravan, since it's a little long in the tooth.  But I thought it would be good to give a nod to this van, since they are often much maligned.  This has been a very economical and reliable van for us, which we bought in 2003, and have driven for the last 13 years with only typical maintenance and repair issues.  East Coast to West Coast and lots of places in between, this van has been a good one for our family.  Not so sure about Dodge Vans since then, and so we're replacing this with a Toyota Sienna, but are sorry for a moment that we bought this Grand Caravan.",1
"Great styling and look, but the 22 inch wheels cause it to ride rough and the center console and glove box are so small they are nearly useless",1
"We have enjoyed this truck since it was new. It now has about 90,000 miles on it.
  I never was impressed with the brakes, so I upgraded to the heavy duty trailer towing package brakes. It now has very good braking ability.
  The spark plugs in the Triton 5.4L engine were a DEMON to change out. The originals have been upgraded to the new design ONE piece design - with ANTISEIZE compound applied to the spark plugs - NO MORE BROKEN OFF SPARK PLUGS !!!!!
  Headlight bulbs upgraded with brighter bulbs. Now has Very Good lighting !
  Plastic cowl vent assembly replaced with Ford OEM due to warping issue.
  Tailgate Ford Blue Oval emblem replaced due to cosmetic issue.
  We finally have the truck upgraded to the level that we want. It is a pleasure to drive.",1
The truck has last 17 years all I had to do was change the oil  and the coil over the spark plug and the truck keep running,1

Very powerful truck.  Great fuel mileage - 24mpg highway!,1
"A great car with a lot of the bells and whistles! Always get compliments about my car whenever I have passengers. 42k miles on it and no technical problems! Only needed the usual matienence check (oil and overall diagnosis) few issues arise, gas mileage becomes an issue when driving long distances. Car engine is loud (could be just me) and the overall ride can be sometimes jerky but it's not often. My only major complaint is that it has a V4 engine. So it's a bit slow on acceleration. Overall it's a fantastic  luxury car if you don't mind taking a few extra seconds to speed up.",1
the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is even with me doing all the repairs myself the parts are so expensive,1
Great utility vehicle.,1
"Had this car since 2000 when we bought it new, had a few maintenance expenses but other than that It has been a very good car, it has 107 K miles now and still running strong",1
"Its a love hate relationship with a Jeep. Im obsessed with it and all the non ending modifications to do to it. Problem is it does have no stop issues. Though I fix the problems myself, parts add up quick. If it was my daily driver and just for cruising around on the weekends and trailing then I would love it even more",1
"I absolutely love this truck for pulling power. The 6.8L V8 cannot be beat for gas engines. As stated in other reviews it does like gas. I installed an IAT sensor that helps with the gas/airflow mix and it has helped some. I now get around 10-11mpg in city driving and approx. 14mpg on hwy. It's still not the greatest, but I agree with others it's a great truck. I have had to replace a few parts and tune ups. Had to replace the ball joints around 100k. Where as with the diesel truck you'll replace ball joints a lot more often because of the weight. I bought the truck used and have been very pleased with the purchase for the most part. I am now getting the usual rear fender rust bubbles on the driver side. Luckily I know a couple of good auto body guys to help me with a replacement fender. Hopefully the passenger side holds up. All in all these are excellent work trucks. I cannot comment on how they rate to newer gas powered trucks, but I have to believe they'll hold their own just fine!",1
The brake system is the downfall of this truck. Anti-lock and brake lines are sub par. Rust loves this truck also.,1
It was alright,1
Reliable easy for a DIY fixes.,1
"This car you can purchase quite cheaply as the book value is not that high. It was going to be the Flagship car for Hyundai new division of upscale cars like Honda has Acura ext.  The upscale never happened however this would be one of the upscale cars. Has a strong 3 liter V-6.
The mass air flow sensor on this vehicle always fails, even with low miles however it is an easy fix but when it happens people sell their cars thus it is a good buy. I bought mine with 65,000 miles three years ago and now I have 87,000 miles  Purchased it for only $3,000.
If you can live through the mass air flow sensor problem it is a great vehicle. Tip, when your mass air flow sensor gives out the car will be not run. If it happens and you are on the road just disconnect the mass air flow sensor and it will drive fine till you get it fixed and that nasty check engine light will go off!",1
A sweet ride that just easts up the miles.....30mpg cruising does not hurt either.,1
"Very dependable auto.  Small engine (4 cyl 2.2)  Cab is small with little adjustment for leg room.  Purchased new in 1998 (only 48,000 miles).  No major problems (transmission or engine).",1
"I bought this vehicle a month ago from the local Ford dealer.  It had less than 27,000 miles on it.  I pretty much like everything about it... nice ride, quiet, handles well.  I play my MP3 player through the sound system and it sounds great too.  Averaging just under 23 mpg with a mixture of city/hwy driving... more city than hwy.  I bought it to haul my R/C planes to and from the flying fields and it really accommodates the planes very nicely.  So far... I'm a very happy camper with my Transit Connect XLT Wagon.",1
"Very reliable car, sporty looking with acceptable fuel economy.
The 4 cylinder version is not what you should go with if you want to use this small SUV to its full extent.
Passenger room is relatively small compared to other small SUV's and with a baby seat in the back, the front passenger does not have any legroom left.",1
"Car has 192,442 miles on it and its still being driven. Tough little car that we bought used 10 yrs ago at an auction for $1,300 bucks! We've done the usual maintenance to it, nothing major. Trying to hit 200,000 before retiring it. Actually going to sell it in June as we are replacing it with a Lincoln Zephyr. We are a Ford/Lincoln Family.",1
"I like the styling and its slightly larger than most small SUV's. The price is good and you don't see one in every other driveway unlike the Honda and Toyota. My last Mitsubishi (Endeavor) was good to me, 13 years with no major problems.
Accessories are available (I made my SE look like a GT with aftermarket add on's).
What I don't like are the little things that make Mitsubishi a cut below the other choices. 2016 the DRL's were not on full time, so many complaints that they fixed this in 2017. The remote start is a separate fob, very hard to use, plus it shuts the car off when you unlock the door. Base audio lacks the features and quality of the other auto makers. The 4 cylinder is just a bit under powered mainly due to the CVT transmission. All in all these are little quirks that I can live with. My biggest complaint is resale value. I was thinking of upgrading to a 2018 GT but my current resale value is less than I still owe on the car.
 All in all it is a good car for the money and if you keep it for a long time it should serve you well.",1
"Its a good well built ""body wise"" truck just gotta keep up on the door bushings. The 96+ 4.3 had coolant, injector issues, ect. The interior doesnt like the sun.",1
Good truck,1
Love the vehicle....,1

I've had my leaf for now 2 years and as a college student that goes to college near home it's perfect. I live in Miami and honestly there are few charging stations but they are usually near popular shopping/dining areas. I love this car but it does limit you. Road trips don't exist in this car but for your day to day commuting it's honestly perfect. I plug it in every night in to the outlets for Christmas lights outside and when I got to school I usually just plug it in the outlets of the garage. Tip most garages have outlets and if you see any trees with Christmas lights on them there's usually an outlet inches from the tree so that help a lot for spontaneous trips with your friends to places.,1
"Runs with very few issues for 17 years old. Common weaknesses are disintegrating spring shackles that are replaceable.  Bed mounts rust, catch a differential leak before it runs dry and burns up, transmission is prone to need serviced,. Rock auto.com has alot of parts cheap.",1

MPG up from 17 to 22 on the Highway.  Went from a 2012 4.7L 6 speed Ram to this 2014 5.7L with an 8 speed trans.  Much smoother shifting.,1
"Well, it's a twelve year old car that I've owned for about 3 years now.  We bought the vehicle as a second vehicle for driving around town, but it's turned out to be a very good vehicle.  Make sure you get the timing belt changed before 100k!",1
My truck does what I need it to do.,1
"Great little truck, does everything well for it's size. But because of it's size, one would think it would & could get better gas mileage.  I see trucks twice it's size and twice the engine size getting 25 m.p.g. and the Ranger struggles to get 19-20 on the hwy with an empty bed & tonneau cover installed.  It is what it is, so drive & enjoy it for all the small truck convenience it will provide. Built to perform & last, plus being a true Mazda.  Any tips that can help improve M.P.G. would be greatly appreciated.

The explorer has been an overall great dependable vehicle that's excellent in the snow,1
Good older vehicle.  Fun to make off road improvements.,1
"I've been driving my MVP for over a year now and outside of routine maintenance and recently replacing a battery, I've not had to put any money into it. However, it's now at 125,000 miles and I am finding an issue with the transmission not shifting down when accelerating uphill or when trying to accelerate to pass someone, for example. It will kick into neutral and the rpm's will go into the red unless you let off the gas. Once you let off though, the tranny will engage and you can continue to drive. I drive mostly in an urban location so it works for me but I cannot go on long trips through the hills of upstate New York.",1
Gas prices are headed up and I have a car that's excellent on gas.,1
Great vehicle durable and runs well,1

"Great little trail blazer (hehe)

Very light and good clearance.  Can be better but, in stock form, it's still decent.

Had electric 4x4.  Had issues down the road but never got around to fixing it.  Heard it's a common issue with these.  I think it was a module that needed replacing down on the transfercase or transmission that gets wet and rusts....

Electrical problems are the main issue with this car.  Dash and insturment cluster has issues once they get rusty or moldy (let it sit for a while up here in western washington...bad idea).

Installed short tube headers, electric fans for radiator (helped with responsiveness), air tube/filter (makes a cool sound), stereo/subs/door speakers, and lastly I replaced the lights with LEDs which need a digital thing for the blinkers...digital blinker lol..something.

Other than the issues, the truck did everything I asked and never left me on the side of the road.  Had it for 10 years now and I put 60k miles on it and 10k of them was off road.",1
Very dependable fast and roomy and we'll buy another one,1
"Great truck. Underpowered by today's standards, but there are lots of mods to be had for it. Gas mileage is of course poor, and changing sparkplugs is not for the feint of heart. Over-all a good truck.",1
It is a great pickup for a half ton. The only reason for 4 stars is because pickups should be 3/4 ton and diesel.  Everything works awesome though.,1
"Even though, it is a relatively old car, VW 2001 model, is very reliable and nice body design (contemporary); like any car, it requires  to be good maintained ( follow the recommendation of VW always). Also, it is easy to find spare parts, even for the  body, engine and interiors, Amazon is a good source for them!",1
Nothing should go wrong if you don't keep up with it's maintenance daily.,1
"First off, I do like this Equinox. This is the second Chevy I've ever owned. I'm 6-3 and like my leg and ""nut"" room. I'm especially impressed with the generous rear leg room for those days when I let my wife drive, who really does not like this car because of the seats are non-supportive for her. It's 4 cyl., AWD, and handles fairly well and got pretty decent gas mileage. It has nice air conditioning. The doors open wide for easy access but the front doors have a tendency to flop back on you when you're trying to get out. I kept the Sirius radio but the OnStar was an unnecessary luxury. With all that said, this is our second one, but not by choice. We drove our first one, a 2013, not long after we bought it new in September 2012, for a break-in road trip to California and back home to the tune of about 5000 miles.  We drive a lot (we traded in our 2005 Dodge Caravan with 175000 miles) and come two years later, its got 65000 miles. My wife drives home from work one night and said it smelled funny. At three in the AM when I left for work the next day I thought it smelled funny (it was parked in our garage) but I couldn't do anything about it. She drove to work the next morning and the oil light came on and it quit running. Limping in to work, she called the dealer. As it turns out, the engine went kaput - the modern equivalent of the PCV system had plugged and was dumping moisture in the oil. Not good. Engine rebuilt under warranty. Lots of oil to clean up in my garage. So we traded it in for a 2015. This one was still a four-banger but it's all-wheel-drive - much better in the snow but not as good gas mileage. Fast forward to 30000 miles (a few months ago), the radiator cracks at the upper seam. I like driving this, my wife doesn't but she will. The first Chevy I ever owned was a 1976 Impala. I bought it for 150 bucks, put another 150 bucks in it, drove it for six months, then put it in the demolition derby (I didn't win but it was fun anyway). I'm not sure I'd buy another Equinox, though, unless it was a six cylinder because I cant resist the comfort for my long legs. I've had three Dodge Caravans, which I felt was my perfect vehicle - I'd say the Equinox is about third on that list. I'd hesitate to recommend this vehicle until I find out if it makes 100000 miles in one piece.",1
Solid strong and comfortable car,1
180k miles and still running,1
"Nice look, comfortable, roomy, acceleration is questionable. It sticks kind of jerky.",1
"As all Volvo owners know, or need to know, is that Volvos need a disciplined maintenance schedule implemented
upon purchase, new or used. Volvos are an elegant, near luxury vehicles sensibly thought out, and are fun to drive,
but they like a lot of attention. They are robust enough to perform well overtime, but only if maintained on schedule.
The 98 V70 was a refinement of the previous year's 850. Although it has many advances, it wasn't until 2000 that further electronic
advancements were added. Although effective, they added significantly to the cost of the maintenance program.
The 98 non turbo V70 (the most reliable and efficient version extant) I bought had 112K and came with a 28 services
performed carfax report. The car is not quick off the line, but has plenty of grunt once underway. The clean lines of the
wagon hold up very well over time.",1
"First of all, it's a truck. We've used it since 2009 for truck-things,  like plowing, tree pulling , stone hauling, etc. my wife says ""it rides like a buckboard"", but that's usually when it's with just she and I , an empty 8' bed, and at qualifying weight ( meaning about 15 mikes to empty :)
  Overall, it's been a damn good truck. Little things like less than high quality leather on the steering wheel and front seats have been things I'd like to upgrade. And, if you're over 6'2"" tall ( I'm at 6'4""), you'll find there's not much leg support and the lumbar is slightly ineffective.
  Things to keep in mind;
 the fuel we get nowadays is pretty much junk, so every 4-5k, put in a large bottle of Royal Purple fuel sysytem cleaner in to keep parts happy
 drop in a half quart of SeaFoam into the crankcase 500-1000 mikes prior to oil changes, and the second half into fresh oil to clean the funk out of running parts.
 put on a K&N cold air intake for stronger operations
 if you're over 50k in miles, invest in a any day you'd like car wash program , as it'll prolong the body and undercarriage.
 have your oil change program include lining ALL points of movement under the vehicle, including all steering linkages.
 think about some Warn front hubs.... they're a good alternative.
  Lastly, take decent care of the truck, and it'll take care of you. As I tell my wife when she's driving it; "" it's a truck, NOT a tank""....",1
"Gas mileage is only modest, but otherwise love everything about this truck!",1
Great vehicle.  Gets me anywhere I need to in bad weather or mud.  Only problem is it is underpowered.  A larger engine was placed in later models that might correct this.  Love the bright color.  This is my 4th jeep.,1
I have had my mazda MPV for about 4 years now. I purchased it used with over 100k miles on it. Overall it has been very dependable. When it needs fixing the parts are a bit pricey and there is no affordable repair manual available because the 2006 is the last year they made the MPV.  It fits our needs for this family of 7.,1
Good car. Economical. Good car for work or school.,1
"Good for WI winters, but lots of wind sounds in the car because of the way the door windows seal",1
"All in all a fantastic truck. The US tax dollars well spent. I did have some issues with the drive shaft u joints, leaking around the satellite antenna, and a few other minor issues due to manufacturing defects. The 8 speed does shift hard now and again but, other than those items the truck runs like a champ.",1
"The choice of limousine services for its era, the Town Car has amenities that are common on most cars now but would have been luxury add ons back in the day; power leather seats, digital dash, etc).  With good service, the engine still purrs with over 180K miles.  The standard air bag suspension system was replaced in 2017 with coil springs as trying to find replacement parts has gotten more.difficult.  Huge trunk space, steady handling one might expect in a car this size.",1
"I love this car. My 2005 Ford Focus my family bought brand new. I am the third sibling to have the car and even with 160,000+ miles, it still runs with ease. I have had to put a decent amount of money into the car here and there, but the car itself is just fine. It just started rusting after 11 years.",1
"I love my 03 S10 Blazer. I've had no ploblems with any of the blazers I've owned. Currently in process of making it look more aggressive, 2"" spacers, light bar, soon to have some nasty meaty tires. My possibilities are endless.",1
Great car to drive. Very nimble and predictable. Reliable and cheap to maintain,1
"only thing that could be better is the fuel mileage. 20 mpg.  handles and drives perfect. lots of room, easy to park,4x4 when needed",1
I enjoy driving my 2004 Volvo S60.  I have had to complete some minor repairs which are normal for a car of his age and miles.  It is dependable and sporty while still having the 4 doors and room for a family car.  After market parts are generally cheap and most things I am able to fix myself when they come up.  The Swedes make it relatively easy for a DIYer to get it done.,1
"Yes, it's old, with 200,000 miles, but it's paid for and fixing it is cheaper than a new one. And except for the paint, it looks like new; I have taken very good care of it.",1
good,1
"Not quite as heavy as oem part but more than ok. I am pleased with quality,price and shipping.",1
My truck,1
"not very good mileage, repairs higher than normally expected
but plenty of power.",1
"I have had the vehicle for 10 years, just over 101,000 miles and the one problem was starting the vehicle since it has the anti-theft system. Dealer put in a new starter and no problem since they did that.",1
Great vehicle with many capabilities. But one needs to understand like all LandRovers they have there issues.,1
"This car isn't flashy or particularly sporty, but I've got almost 200,000 miles on mine, it's easy to work on, parts are readily available, the fuel mileage is good for a 20 year old car, and it just keeps going.",1
Original parts low prices,1
"Fits truck well,but could have more of an over hang.",1
"The vehicle is very comfortable it the LTZ model has all the top features of many european cars. The vehicle's interior is very roomy and it provides a feeling of safety and security. Perhaps the best features in the captain chairs in the second row and the DVD player for our young kids. The adults can have a conversation or enjoy music without the annoying interruptions. The outside of the vehicle is very modern and it is higher from the ground than other competitors . The drive is very smooth and you can hardly feel or hear the outside traffic. This is a true luxury ride.

However, the price of this luxury vehicle it's just as high or even higher than other top European models. While the European models maintain a higher  re-sale value or trade-in value. This vehicle would be more marketable and obtainable for many consumers if the price was more reasonable.",1
"I needed a truck to replace my Ford Ranger 4x4 that I drove into the ground after 20+ years. I found a white commercial F150 with a long bed, stick, and a V6. Its underpowered but has a good low end +torc for hauling so it meets my needs at 19 miles/gal. paid 8k with 45k miles back in 2010 so it was 4 years old. Needed a wheel bearing on drivers side and got the front disk brakes done at that time as well. Other than that it now has 80k miles and have not put a dime into it except a new battery last year, AC recharge, oil, and a few exterior plastic parts that disintegrated - trim by the windshield. Its a 2006 so is now 11 years old!  Seats are uncomfortable (plastic) after a 3 hour drive, definitely not in the Toyota minivan. I'm guessing this truck doesn't have the spark plug issues that the big v8 has.
Long bed is great but makes it unwieldy to park, best to back in to parking spots.",1
Love the car even though it has had its share of problems.,1
"Car is great. A little small sometimes, but that's to be expected for a sports sedan. This is my second one (also had 2000 330i)  so you can tell how much I love it.",1
"Gas mileage averages 17-18 mi/gal between local and highway driving. Roomy. Comfortable. Decent cargo space. Poor visibility due to placement of rear view mirror, when checking for right side oncoming traffic at an intersection, if you are tall. Handles well in the snow with 4WD.",1
"Jeeps are quirky and fun to drive. We have owned them since the 1950's. This version is very nicely done. The weakest factor is acceleration.
A vehicle this heavy should be working at around 330 HP in gasoline and 250 HP in diesel configurations. More safety features are necessary (lane intrusion monitoring, back up cameras, side impact bags, etc. Most owners use them in urban settings 90% of the time.
Hopefully the new models will pay attention to the power anemia.",1
"I like the cargo space and room capacity inside the cab. I use mine to tow a 22 ft wellcraft to the beach or lakes, so I need that v-8 power . That 5.3 liter is very strong and powerful. When on vacation , everybody can pile in on car and go to dinner . At 167,000 miles I have a tap in top end of engine , which came after I was persuaded by the dealership to go to the blended oil from conventional. I just  replaced the entire ac unit. No transmission problems ,no differential problems with 4x4.  I think it a very practical vehicle",1
"The Volvo XC90 was a newly released model in 2004 and we immediately fell in love with it. We ordered ours direct from the factory to be delivered overseas. Of course this model has had its ups and downs, the least of which is the transmission. Ours had to be changed out twice, first at about 30,000 miles and again around 60,000 miles, but fingers crossed we will get to ride it into oblivion considering after 14 years, she still has not broken the 100,000 threshold. The XC90 looks like a light weight tank and handles like a sports car. The driver's dominance while towering over the surrounding traffic is a feeling not to be missed. If you can pick one up with somewhat low mileage for a few grands, go for it.",1
Hands down the finest car in the world. Easy to work on for the most part. And the inline five diesel will run forever!,1
I have had mine for 7 years now runs better now than when I bought it. I drove it for the first 3 years no problem then just routine maintenance.now just new hoses and belts.good for another ten years!,1
"My second Saturn. They all seem to get good gas mileage. This one with the double overhead cam engine and automatic transmission gave me 28 to 31 MPG on a 640 mile round trip to L.A. Cal. from Phoenix, AZ. in 88 to 112 temperatures (July 2016).However the Saturns seem to have a poorly designed radiator that seems prone to cracking on the top inside corner just below the radiator hose.(driver side). My first Saturn (1996 2 door) cracked at 120,000 miles. This 1999 has now cracked at 111,000 miles, in the same place. Still a great used car with, I believe, above average gas mileage for the years made.",1
"plenty of power, only issues was front caliper/rotors going out at 21k",1
I am a big man and the Cube affords me plenty of head and leg room while still allowing someone to sit in the seat behind me comfortably. It is not the quickest car around but it is good enough for me,1
"I was looking for a vehicle to replace my 4-wheel drive PU truck. I wasn't using it like a truck much. This vehicle is perfect for me.  I take it camping, hiking, and into the many places here in Oregon toff the beaten trail. I don't use it to go off  rode where there is not a path at least.

It does have real differential lock and 4-wheel drive low if I ever get into a tough spot. I use 2 wheel and 4 wheel high most of the time. Lot's of things to like. A few things I don't like or could be better. The rear passenger windows don't roll down.  My dogs can't put their heads out the window. Rear and side visibility is limited. With the spare covering the back glass and mirrors too close in it creates blind spots. Some stick on concave mirrors in the corners of the mirrors fix that issue.

All in all, this is great vehicle, my friends may tell me it's not as trail ready as a Jeep but for my use it's perfect and I like it's looks and style. And in the end, I like it a lot better than an Escape or Forester.",1
"Dependable at 32K miles, as I expected.  It does what I bought it for.  One improvement would be to increase the width of the bed to give 48"" between the wheel wells.  It is only a couple of inches short of doing that.  Another, the truck has side mirror integrated turn lights.  It would be a convenience to see the light from the mirror side.  At my age, I have trouble hearing the turn signal beep.",1
"I'm a bit of a car enthusiast. I've taken performance driving courses for both Porsche and BMW; I've driven everything from a Porsche 911 Turbo, a Boxster, a Mazda RX-7, a BMW M3, etc. So when I say that this car is quite amazing, you should know it comes with a ""Swanson"" level guarantee when it comes to cars.

The acceleration is quite fulfilling for a 4 door sedan. It's meant to compete with GS350 Sports, BMW 340i, and Audi S6 and so far it doesn't disappoint. I've driven the other 3 cars when looking to pick up this vehicle and for the price and performance, it can't be beat. There are very minor things I wish Infiniti would get right. Tires for starters and interior trim pieces. It also misses out on some quality control when it comes to rattling in the car. I've noticed 2 spots where the rattling is quite noticeable and quite annoying and it seems to be a common issue. Maybe you'll be lucky. Maybe you aren't as anal about it as I am.

Even with that though, you won't be disappointed.",1
Good car no problems,1
I bought mine from Hertz. Yep it was a rental. I got a great deal on it with 42000 miles. It's a bare bones package really but with the 6 cylinder engine it's a blast to drive! No issues at all so far after a year. I'd buy this thing again in a heart beat. No regrets. Did I mention it's stupid quick?,1
"My 03 convertible has the old 4 cyl turbo. Fast and powerful, 22-26 mpg. Check engine lights a pain, seems not to affect performance. In a year drove from 68K to 79K and only replaced plugs, ignition cassette and serpentine belt. Changed fluids in auto trans , power steering,coolant, brake reservoir and of course synthetic oil. Nice leather interior, easy top down and solid road feel. This car should last me a while.",1
"I absolutely love my durango.  To me it's the best looking suv on the market.  I bought the R/T version with the 5.7L Hemi.  It has plenty of power and can tow just about anything I want which most suvs in this class cannot.  I like the technology features it has like the large 8"" touch screen with voice controlled features, power lift gate, remote start, heated and vented seats and heated middle row seats.  I also like how dodge put the black pillars and headliner to match the rest of the interior.  Also really like the hid headlights, led running lights and taillights.  Has a decent ride, firm at times on certain rough roads, but I think it's due to the lower profile tires on the 20 inch rims.",1
"PROS: So far so good.  Small and fuel-efficient(36mpg avg).  Just what I wanted. Nice ride.  Good front visibility - way better than Elantra. CarTech!  Phone Apps for your car
CONS: Odd acceleration - laggy kind of? Start/Stop will take some getting used to.  Chrome dash bits reflecting in the windows/side mirrors is annoying!  Too much CarTech! for me, Phone Apps for your car",1
"Very reliable truck, engine and transmission.  The only major repair was the computer.  Still driving regularly with over 160,000.",1
It is a real nice truck. You need to keep up on all repairs. It will do anything you ask. But if you don't do all she asks she will leave you out in the woods by your self.,1
Good truck,1
Everything was as expected,1
"Not your speedster but for someone always on the go with the family this is for you. The B series motor is very easy to work on and parts are very abundant and cheap. Decent cargo room but add a cargo bag to the top and you'd should be all set. Decent fuel economy in the city and on the highway. I have a 5 speed so it geared for more stop and go. On the highway cruising at 80mph, you're sitting around 3.5k rpms. I'm in my mid 30's and have had some fast cars. Mine has coils and wheels and it's always funny to get the thumbs up from kids. Overall, a decent little compact SUV with real time all wheel drive should your paths get slippery.",1
Dependable; do not let the gasoline light come on; after that you only have 1 gallon of gas before the car will come to a stop and the fuel pump will burn itself up and need replaced .  A $400 garage visit :(,1
All automobiles have problems or issues with them but the maxima has had minor problems that can be fixed with not having alot of money & the parts that has been needed other people that have car knowledge of Nissans can fix it wout too many tools. It's fast or powerful spacious & luxurious  at the same time,1
"I have owned my truck since 06 and have over 120,000 miles on it. Just had a chevy dealer install a new instr. cluster at a cost of $680.00. Ouch! Other then that just normal maintenance stuff.",1
Great truck but minor defects and recalls prevent a five star rating.,1
Great suv,1
I love the car in generally. Lots of space and comfortable. But too many problems that seem common throughout all the Vue's. Oil pan/plug known for being stripped easily and needing to be replaced. Known to have reservoir sensor issues. All problems are not an easy fix because they are too common and Saturn no longer being in business. GM does not have all parts available that need to be replaced :(,1
"It is the perfect urban warrior. Big tires and tough suspension for crumbly NYC streets, you sit high to see over traffic, and god forbid someone makes contact with you, the fenders are plastic!  Bolt on, bolt off!  Snow/ice...4 wheel drive, bring it on.
Highway driving...22-24 MPG, not bad for vehicle with all the aerodynamic qualities of a pile of shoe boxes.
The thing I like the least?  The 2011 has a V6 that is kind of anemic on the highway.  I have the 6 speed Getrag transmission which you need to work to get the right power curves at all speeds.
But, is iconic, fun, and will go anywhere.  Somehow the other rules don't apply... it's a Jeep!",1
"Good truck. I haven't had any major issues. Nice power. Comfortable ride. Gas mileage isn't so hot but, it's a big V8 & heavy. I'd buy another F150.",1
"Good car, almost 200,000 miles and no major breakdowns.",1
Reliable fast fun car to drive.,1
I have loved this car and have almost 300K.  It is very smooth and very comfortable.  My critics has been the transmission.  I am on my 3rd transmission.  The CRV transmission is delicate and the fluid needs to be changed every 50K or it will not last.  My dealership sucks as well.,1
Love the van.  Very reliable and plenty of room.,1
Awesome car.  Drives really nice.  A beast in the snow and wet weather.  Maintenance is very expensive.  I do most of my own work so that helps.,1
Good reliable truck.  Over a quarter million miles and running strong.,1
"I have so many bad, terrible things about the car. I looked them over and for the price thought what the hell. The car is good basic transportation... anywhere from 28 to 31 mpg. It is comfortable to drive. I have the 2.0 liter engine with a 5 SPD stick. Power windows, a/c, radio package with XM. It is little under powered but hey I did not buy it for power. I have put over10k on it. Really like the car. Jeep  really screwed up on this car. They could have made the doors open wider. Put in 180hp engine as stock and had a 200hp as option. 6spd auto not the CVT trans. Had the option of the back window opening. Car is the right size for what I want. Jeep made no real improvements and milked the crap out it. I blame Jeep for the failure of the car.",1
"Hardly any storage. 4 small cup holders.

Very reliable and easy to fix.",1
Bmw is a good car...but after a while it's not reliable.,1
I bought this car brand new in 2010. The car has plenty of pickup and rides pretty darn nice. The fit and finish is excellent And best of all no mechanical or electrical problems.  The only faults I can report are: a wide threshold to enter and exit the vehicle and the turn signal and high beam indicator  on the same wand. This annoying design causes me to hit the high beams every time I use the turn signals.,1
"It's been a good car, dependable mostly. Easy for the kids to get in and out. A bit undepowered which causes more gas pedal and not so good mpg. 4 seater only.",1
"Insulation on wiring starting to crack every where, but the car runs great. Make sure you get a 4 wheel alignment periodically or you will eat up tires quickly. I have about 200k on the odometer.",1
"Good on gas.  Pretty reliable.  Pretty roomy back seat and trunk.  Fun to drive.  Major maintenance is pricy (for repairs; alternator and starter, paid $1,000).  In my area, not too many folks fix VWs. I think this what drives up the maintenance repair prices.

I changed the grill, headlights, tail lights, interior lights and dressed up the interior.  The upgrades help me want to drive it.  But before the upgrades, it looked it's age (old and outdated).",1
Perfect size.,1
"I owned this car from 2001 through 2015.  It had 186,000 miles on it when I turned it in for my new BMW.  It was a manual transmission with AWD, and living in Colorado the AWD was kind of necessary unless you wanted to get Blizzaks for the winter.  Performance wise, this was just OK.  It had that true BMW feel but didn't have the real speed.  Handling was excellent!!  The in-line 6 is an amazing engine and my mechanic said I could get another 150k miles out of it.  ... that was before I got very upset when it left me stranded on the side of the road because of a radiator issue that kept rearing its ugly head.  The initial quality of the build was below average.  I had to replace, on my dime, every window mechanic as the windows stopped working.  In addition, they said change the oil every 15k miles ... haha ... it won't last 7500 miles without you needing to add oil.  I would always have to keep oil in my trunk because the oil levels would fluctuate a lot and I'd have to add oil like every 3500 miles.  From a maintenance perspective, it was very expensive to maintain after the warranty expired.  I had to constantly replace sensors and through all this time, after all the replacements, it was just for peace of mind, as nothing was ever wrong, it was always a bad sensor.  So if you have one or are going to get one, you should have a reliable mechanic that will not charge you an arm and a leg.  Taking it to the BMW dealership for service, on average, will cost you 4-6X what a good mechanic will charge for the exact same work.

All and all, I bonded with this care, loved it, we went through everything together, and I was sad to see it go.  However, with maintenance costs averaging over $270 over the past few years, it just wasn't worth the headache and expense, and that was on the cheap.",1
Great vehicle. Motor is a bit underpowered,1
"Over all I like the car, however there are few things that really bug me about this car. The on-board Navigation is one of the reason I bought this car and it is terrible! The logic is very poor and I will not buy another Nissan if they have not fix this issue. They have a SD card  for the Nav that looses its connection all of the time.
I had a protable Garmin GPS and it works great and if they use the Garmin logic it would be a great fix.
I also am having a problem with the Air conditioning not working correctly with only 109k. I will be looking at Toyota and Honda for my next car.",1
"This was an extremely comfortable and generally reliable car. Unfortunately, as it aged, the number of repairs necessary grew. When a brake line rusted through right after I replaced the fuel pump, I finally scrapped it.",1
"170K miles so far. Only problems were electric door locks, a fuel pump and it goes thru catalytic converters too fast. Will carry heavy loads of sand or anything else.",1
"I was at a local bank auction way back in 2001. Was actually wanting to purchase a full size, but on the way out I saw a little 4 cyl. S-10 with low miles and in perfect condition. Put in a really low bid......like 1/3 book value. Turned out I didn't get either full size truck I bid on, but the S-10 was mine. I actually figured I would just sell it and make some money, but after driving it for a few weeks it kinda grew on me. Rode nice, great on gas, and like I said, was basically a new truck. All these years later still going strong !",1
"this car is mostly reliable, however mpg leaves much to be desired.  this thing has been hit four times and has kept me in one piece everytime.  if you are looking for stability, this is it.",1
"Love this car, bought it new in 2007, has a few miles on it (94,000) had to replace the housing around the water pump.  Have the V-6, it has plenty of get up and go.  Only complaint is the front spoiler, it can not be parked with a parking lot barrier in front, the spoiler goes over, but it will rip it up eventually, when backing up.",1
"A strong car with stable control very very powerful.but not comfortable at all you can feel the cracks of the road even it has a comfortable suspension option but  like a lie, Another point is the stupid  they costy spare parts, they say that the price  of old model spare parts are same like the new ones.",1
Goog service and parts,1
The order was cheap but it didn't fit for kia its for different car,1
"Car is excellent, but I 2x4 butter than 4x4 , because 4x4 is haver and The steering wheel of 2x4 more flexible .",1
"Great car. space, speed , reliability . Only issue i have is the front end steering and suspension components being so short lived . i got mine at 30k now at 155k. 3rd set of front suspension. includes  shocks, tension struts, upper control arms, lower control arms , spindle lower ball joint, inner and outer tierods, sway bushings and end links . always replace with MOOG . OEM fades faster. only got stuck once with a bad fuel pump ( i ran it below Empty every other day for 4 years though. NYC city driven exclusively .",1
"It is like a barbie,  there's a lot of products that you can get to put in and on. But ever is a fun auto. Not to fast on the highway, but fun off road.",1
"Lots of fun and certainly no more maintenance intensive then MBZ, VW, Porsche, Audi's that I've owned or for that matter, most any other car brands because they all require service and repair. The key to lower maintenance is to be a DYI and then they all become much, much cheaper. Mini parts are more reasonable than the above cars I mentioned so if you can turn a wrench the costs are very manageable.",1
Great car but expensive to maintain but so fun to drive.,1
I like my car but the heater doesn't work very well. It is pretty much cold blooded. Never gets really warm.,1
"This has been a good replacement for our worn out Ford Windstar, although my wife is not as enamored as I (she liked the additional room in the Windstar, and has a little trouble judging the width of the Edge).  My main complaint is the touchscreen interface for most of the console functions.  I'm an old knob and button kinda guy, and when I have to divert my attention from the road to change a function, it's not only inconvenient but reduces my feeling of overall safety in the car.  Granted, I would have the same concerns over any vehicle that relies on a screen interface.",1
"My wife and I just got an EX. The drive is OK, but if you are used to a V6 this engine will feel slow and with not enough power. This is a small SUV, not a lot of room, but OK for a family of 3 or 4. If you are getting a new one, don't pay more than $26K for the EX version. Overall, just an OK vehicle, nothing great about it.",1
ultra reliable,1
"One of the best vehicles that I've ever owned. I purchased it new. It now has 215,000 miles on it so it doesn't go too far from home anymore. Still looks and runs great!",1
"I have the Limited model with all the bells and whistles, 97,000 miles. This van is AWESOME! Very comfortable on trips, and the kids can watch movies in the back, keeps them quiet for a little while anyway. The van would have earned 5 stars except It has power sliding doors and the passenger door will not work. If it gets open by accident, takes an engineer to get it closed again. Also it needs a spark plug change and you have to take apart the rear of the engine compartment including the intake manifold to get to the rear plugs. It also has bluetooth and will not connect to newer phones like my iPhone 6s. The van still deserves at least 4 stars, I have the automatic moon roof, heated leather seats power fold down rear seating, rear air and heat that will run you out, power heated side mirrors with turn signals, GPS navigation system with backup camera. Side air bags, and the list just keeps going. I am going to take it to Toyota about the rear door, but I am going to try to tackle the tuneup myself.",1
very smooth drive dependable car.,1
"It's a fun ride, decent gas mileage, comfy interior. Road noise is a little much and ride is kinda hard too. I have a 2011 limited.",1
"for being a compact, its as good if not better than the ones in its class. Dependability: Good, Maintenance: No cheap date, my MB service dealer: Good as it gets in 45069!. I recently upgraded to the E Class for more room and love it!",1
Love it,1
"Fun to drive.  The 5 speed manual and the 2.5L went well together.  Too many rattle and squeaks.  My wife has the 2013 which did not suffer from the rattles and squeaks.  No longer have it, moved into a truck.  I do miss driving it now and then.",1
Good solid rig. Runs forever. I have 140K on mine and it's still running great,1
"Bought this truck used in 1998 with 63,000+ miles on the odometer...  Great little truck, 5.7L, TBI, strong running...  Rebuilt auto trans about 75,000, spun a rod bearing in the engine at 124,000...  Replaced engine with new long block from Jegs in Columbus, OH, now has about 168,000...  Many owners of these trucks, with the 5.7L TBI engines, report a surging condition around 45 to 65 mph once the truck reaches a cruising speed...  I recently learned the reason for that condition...  I visited forums, shops, Chevy/GMC shops, and various mechanics, but nobody could tell me what was causing the throttle surge...  While on vacation in West Virginia visiting old friends/family, a cousins son-in-law told me to check the Throttle Position Sensor, on the passenger side of the throttle body...  I replaced the sensor, drove it about 50 miles, so the ECU could catch up to it, and I no longer have the surge...",1
"I received this car as a gift in December of 2015.  After 8 months of replacing routine maintenance items, shocks, struts, sway bar ends, battery, all fluids, repairing the corroded aluminum rims so the tires did not leak, a few light bulbs, front breaks, rotors and calipers; the car is now road worthy and is very nice.  I have added a blue tooth interface to the radio and I am ready to go.  I have the 'Custom' version and I am looking forward to may years, starting mileage is 38,000 in Dec of 2016.",1
"210000 miles and still strong.  Paint not so much to look at now, and the smog stuff was replaced as well as the idler pulley.",1
"4 cyl, 6 speed auto. 8K mile trip across US 11.2 cents a mile. Rocky mtns, cascade mtns no problems.stayed cool in the deserts.",1
"Great build quality and with the Cummins 6.7 turbo diesel you can't go wrong for a long lasting truck. A couple of caveats is that the EGR system needs to be cleaned all the time and the DPF regenerates too often but, if you remove both systems the truck will last for a long time. Most Cummins 6BT turbo diesels run up to 1 million miles before a rebuild.",1
Keep an EYE on the front coil spring / shock mount - bolted to the frame inside front wheel wells.  Notorious for rusting out on top and spring shoves through to inner fender.  Garage stored and washed inside the wheel wells often they may last long time.  If you have to replace them with internet parts and non-dealer rates expect to pay $250.00 per side.  If you DIY then $60.00 parts per side.  I trusted my friend of 53 years and discovered he had replaced the driver side but not passenger.  Still a good purchase 1994 Reg Cab XLT Lariat 5.0 long bed.  Caveat emptor.  Hit a bump and front right fender dropped 4 inches.  HELLO!  It could have been worse.,1
Never give me hard mechanical problem just the regular maintenance. Best car ever and for the price excellence.,1
"Bought this new and still have it with 126K miles.  Pros - still looks and runs great.  Plenty of power.  Very solid car.  I expect it will make 200K miles although I won't be driving it that far.  Cons - window regulators break for no reason and cost $4-500 each to repair.  Once replaced seem to last though.  All of the AC system had to be replaced at 85K miles - cost $3500.  Had some control arm cracks at 100K that cost $2,500 to replace, but in hindsight should have skipped that. I seriously doubt I would have had problems from the cracks.  Factory brake pads only last around 25K miles and rotors usually have to be replaced too, so it is a costly repair.  Now using Akebono Ceramic pads which last much longer.  Plan to drive this car to at least 160K miles as it has very little value now even though it is still in such great shape.  Around that point I'll buy a new one.  Great gas mileage too - 29-30 on highway and 25 or so everyday.",1
The e36 is a great drivers car enough power to keep up with modern cars and excellent through the twistys. The down sides are these cars are older and all rubber bushings will need to be changed.,1
"I have put 225,000 miles on this truck and its still going strong. Replaced fuel sensors, radiator, timing belt, water pump.",1
"Traded in my 2005 Prius. A minor annoyance is that the '05 would let you open any door and hatchback with key in pocket, now only the driver door. Also, at this point, don't think that GPS should be extra. Other than-- drives great, great mileage, spacious, looks great.",1
"My Camary is the most reliable car I have ever owned. I've had Cadillac's, Lincolns, Mercedes, Lexus, and none have been more worry and trouble free than my Camary",1
"The most reliable car I have so far. I bought it in 2008 and it has 210k km on now, still runs perfectly.  I don't race, but I definitely not the type that baby my car either, still the original clutch, had some problem with the gear last year, bleed the clutch and it's all good again.  Too bad it's no longer available.",1
Rough riding,1
Maintainance is expensive due to airmatic system.,1
"40,000 miles.  So far so good.  Could use more horsepower but it is adequate.  Rides okay,  A little mushy.  Has the 6 foot bed and has been adequate.  Would have gotten a full sized pick up if they weren't so damn big.  I don't need the full size capacity 90% of the time.  4 wheel drive works good in snow but with the coming of global warming I won't be needing it.",1
"Pros: Dependable car.  Nice styling.  Nice features.  Has never required major repair work. Comfortable.  Handles nicely.
Cons:  4-cyl doesn't have a lot of ""giddy up and go"" power.  Blunt front profile isn't the best for gas economy plus small rocks make for lots of little pit marks in the paint.  Front seat side airbag covers on the columns get loose at the top all the time in hot weather and you have to smack them with your hands to put them back in place.  Seems to be rough on tires....always replacing tires before the wear warranty runs out.  Has a factory recall on the dash and another for excessive oil consumption.  Have not taken it in but s few very small flakes have come off the dash and the car uses about 1 qt. of oil every 1000 miles.",1
"Excellent vehicle option for towing RVs  up to 15,000 lbs.  Towing anything bigger....one should consider the Ram 3500 truck. In my opinion, the engine of choice should be the 6.7 liter Cummins diesel.",1
"Yes, it is the ultimate driving machine. Even with twelve years and 162000 miles it performs better than any of the Volvo or Saab models Ive owned. Number one recommendation - keep up with maintenance using genuine parts. Pricey, but after market parts will wreck performance and cost you in the long run. So, if you cant afford to maintain it, don't buy it.",1
I like it!,1
"At 18 years old this car is still sportier and better looking than most new cars.  Seals are getting old and had to replace transmission at about 120,000 miles but the engine is rock solid.  I plan on keeping it as long as I can.",1
This is a great car! The Best gas mileage!!,1
Good car,1
"I have a 2014 Sierra SLT.  Bought it new.  Never driven off-road.  Don't pull a trailer.  Mostly city stop and go miles.

Love the truck.  Has many small recall and minor warranty issues at the beginning.  One or two minor issues since.  My only real complaint is that it's a bit of a rattle box.  There's always a noise or rattle coming from under the seats or under the dashboard.  I find and fix some, some go away, some hang around.  I've driven GM vehicles my whole life (30 years of driving), from corvettes to mainly yukons and tahoes, a Silverado, and now the Sierra.  I'd probably end up with another Sierra, but not after at least looking at a F150 first.",1
"Dead reliable, use it for towing, getting stuff for the yard/garden, moving large items. Wife uses it for everyday transport, it is comfortable, the A/C rocks, gets decent mileage for its size, 17/22 mpgs with the 5.4L Triton. Easy to get parts for if you need them.",1
"I love my truck.  It does everything I need it to do, was reasonably priced and looks good.  I bough it to tow a large camper and it did a good job at that.  It does take a lot of gas, but its a large V8 Engine.",1
Fites,1
"Has been a great truck. Loads of Power with the diesel, has been dependable. I have 180,000 miles and still going strong.",1
I love my dodge what to say,1
Love it. This is my third wrangler. Could use more horsepower though.,1
Mechanically a wonderful car.  Solid engine and power train.  Has the usual squeeks and rattles typical of the S70 but for a car of this vintage that is to be expected!  Only things I have done to this car in 4 years are tires and a Mass air flow sensor. 132K miles and could easily go another 100K.,1
"I recently purchased a 2001 Ford Focus ZX3 for a cheap commuting car. Wasn't really expecting much but I am quite pleasantly surprised! It has a peppy little 4 cylinder that gets 31-32 mpg hiway. Enough room to be comfortable for my 6'1"" frame and enough room to to be a nice grocery getter. Starts right up when its -20 degrees outside and the heater works great. Now, I just wish it had factory cruise control.",1
"Excellent automobile. The Audi requires extra maintenance with cam followers, oil catch can, and fluid changes (differential) to keep the system running properly.",1
I purchased the car with 68k miles. It needed motors mounts when I bought it and the water pump failed a 1000 miles after I bought it. The Lucerne was comfortable and reliable however the the transmission would stumble at low speeds( like driving around a neighborhood at 35 mph or less). The transmission got progressively worse and had to be replaced. I bought another Lucerne from the original owner after the first one got totaled. My current Lucerne is incredible thanks to the original owner maintaining it. Both cars were the 3.8 v6 stay away from the northstar v8 cars.,1
"Coming up on 7 years of trouble free performance. I bought this automobile with the intention of keeping it for at least 200,000 miles. I am currently at 150k and confident that it will go another 50 without a hitch. It is far from a luxury vehicle but it rides comfortably if a little noisy. The 1.8 liter engine and four speed automatic transmission provide adequate power to navigate hills and highways. I have achieved higher than estimated MPG. Driving 60 percent highway miles I have averaged 34 mpg over the life of this vehicle. I would definitely recommend a Toyota Corolla to anyone looking for a reliable efficient compact car.",1
Good work truck,1
"I purchased my 2004 Eddie Bauer Expedition new in 2004 and I now have 210,000 miles on it.  The only complaint I have ever had is the gas mileage which is about 13 mIles per gallon.  But it has done everything well, and reliably, and it still looks current, not dated.  It is basically indestructible.  When I replace it, I will probably get a newer one just like it.  It probably won't be because of the drivetrain, which is bullet-proof.  It will be because of the little things like worn out seats, the cosmetic dings and scratches, tiny drips of oil under the car, or the electronics gone haywire in the radio/GPS.  Then I'll give it to one of my relatives out west who will love hauling horses with it.",1
"I like the looks, features and ride of my Acadia Denali.  I just wish that it had a more powerful engine as it is rather sluggish on hills and with more than 2 passengers.",1
"This is the first Ford vehicle I have owned in a while and after doing some research and comparing with other vehicles in it's class, I purchased a 2016 Ford Fusion SE AWD 2.0L.  I have to say, based upon the comparison of other vehicles in it's class, the Ford Fusion out-ranks them. There are few mid-sized sedans that offer AWD; the Chrysler 200 S has AWD, but is also $4,000 - $6,000 more.  I would have preferred to have gotten the new 2017 Ford Fusion 3.7L Turbo (after they molded the engine from the F-150 to put it into the Fusion), but couldn't wait another 8 months for a dependable vehicle.
So far, I don't really have too many complaints. After purchasing I took the vehicle to Florida on vacation and it gave me great highway gas mileage with the air condition running the entire trip.  I averaged 27.6 mpg throughout the trip, and have kept around 26.4 mpg since returning (and driving to and from work).
I agree with some other reviews that some aspects of the car could use some improvement. The stereo system and speakers could be a bit more powerful. I have already ordered and will be replacing the factory sound speakers with Polk Audio speakers.
The My Ford Touch system could also use some improvements. I know Ford has released the new Sync3.0 - and it should be an available upgrade to other My Ford Touch owners.  The older system lags a bit and is fairly clunky. I've found the system to cumbersome and troublesome and have to ensure I enter the address I want in the GPS before driving and relying on the 'speak' system since it doesn't hear the prompts or commands very well.
The interior is nicely laid out, and the ride is very soft and comfortable.  The controls are easy to reach and most in the SE package easy to operate. I know in some Titanium models the touch buttons are a bit more troublesome to operate.
Overall, I'm very happy with and like and am proud of my car. I have already done a few upgrades, and when I get finished with some new appearance features, I'll post some photos.
If you're looking for a pretty solid car with good mileage and dependability, the Ford Fusion is one in the top of the segment. I've researched and driven most of the competitors and went with the Ford Fusion due to the available AWD (since I wasn't getting an SUV and needed something with a little more handling ability and dependability in climate weather).
I would give 5 stars but am still feeling the vehicle out. I may increase or decrease my star rating. I have only had the vehicle for about a month.",1
How to really like how this car right,1
"I'm about 43,000 miles into my Golf. I bought a Night Blue Metallic, 4Door S w/Sunroof 5Spd 1.8T TSI. My biggest complaint is that the manual transmission is not available with any decent options. I have no issues with my Golf other than the constant groaning coming from the front end suspension. Volkswagen service center can never hear the problem. They finally hear it and don't properly fix the problem.",1
Needs love,1
"The most reliable car I have ever had. Though there were a couple of issues, all very minor. Mostly loved it, there are a couple of things that just annoyed me:  like coming home from the store, get the bags out of the trunk first into the house, come back out to get the bags out of the back seat, but the doors have automatically locked. I have to go back into the house and get the keys to unlock, ugh!! The floor of the trunk isn't flat, so everything slides to the middle. The glove compartment, when you open it everything falls out... things like that, just minor annoyances :0)",1
i like the size large interior great for family road trip but a little problem on its electrical parts,1
"I've only had it six months, but so far I love this truck.  The only reason I didn't rate the Tacoma at 5 stars is because of a slight lack of power.  I feel the 2nd generation Taco is about 25-50 hp underpowered.  I bought this truck based on the reliability and reputation of Toyota and this model.  With regular maintenance and TLC, I expect to get 500K out of the truck before I trade for another Tacoma or a Tundra.",1
"The Mazda Tribute was based on the design on the Ford Escape. The vehicle is fairly reliable but has a great deal of problems. The EGR system is known to give problems which can cause a multitude of error codes and cause the CATs the become burnt out. My model is a 3.0 V6 4x4. The engine is mounted sideways which makes working on them a complete chore. For example, changing the rear plugs requires taking the entire air intake system apart. Short of repairing them, when you get one that doesn't have problems, they are a great car.",1
"I bought my '04 Titan used from a local neighbor, 170k miles.  It is roomy, good power from the V8 engine, smooth shifting transmission, excellent gauge package.  Mine has the towing and hauling package (with tailgate extension).  Paint looks great everywhere except the flat surfaces of hood, front fender tops & top of cab, where it has faded and clear-coat is peeling.  Also, some dash electrical issues with LED odometer intermittently working and a/c & heat ticking noise when changing air direction.

Overall, great vehicle.",1
Bought this car from off lease and it has been pretty reliable. Still has a really nice ride!,1
"Bought this car used.  Love it.  The only things I don't like - and the reason for the 4 star rating: 1) only two cigarette lighter ports, one in the center console (under the center arm rest) the other in the back seat 2) I work on my cars myself, very difficult to change the transmission fluid 3) I have the 4 cylinder model, good power, but not great 4) no trunk release button in the car, you have to use the key fob.  Great car, not an awesome car.",1
The car is a little tank. Its up to 178K miles and going strong.,1
"Small truck with tremendous durability as far as how long the truck will last. I bought one because my friend has a 1997 model and he's closing in on 350,00 miles. The ride is not what you get in a full-size truck but it has better mileage, is easier to climb into and is easier to park because of its size. If you don't really need a big truck and don't want to pay Toyota prices, then consider the Ranger.",1
"Not Perfect, but Great Truck.",1
"This is the best car overall that I have ever owned, and I have had many cars in my 44 years of driving. This Sonata has never given me any problems. I have 185000 miles on it and the issues I can list are really not bad, for it's age. (11 years old)  The paint is pealing, the front end suspension makes noises,  the power windows are about shot, but mechanically, it is still sound.  I have two newer cars, but I choose my Sonata as my daily driver.",1
Nice car many extras and a smooth ride,1
"Purchased used in 2010, had just under 50K, now has 220K.  Very reliable and low maintenance.  Transmission has always had shifting issues; However, still roadworthy.",1
"This vehicle is insane, 23 years old and the engine, while at 330,000 miles, still kicking smooth.",1
"I searched for this vehicle specifically in LT trim for about 8 months, (from as far away as Everett, Washington, and Yankton South Dakota, to states closer to my home state of Florida), I probably looked at 300-400 vehicles. So imagine my surprise when I found a fresh trade in 25 miles from my home at Gary Smith Honda in Fort Walton Beach. This vehicle is exactly what I was looking for (including all desired options). When I found it, I owned it within 2 hours of discovering it.it is a one owner, low mileage car (was owned by the proverbial older lady, who never used the DVD player and possibly never used the CD changer). The interior and exterior are like new, (I know because I test drove it before it was cleaned for delivery). I absolutely love this van. (American car manufacturers have abandoned the minivan to foreign companies ""pity, since they built them so well"").But if you want a nice vehicle, (and you can find one with the right price and mileage), I highly recommend the 2008 Chevrolet Uplander LT (power doors on both sides). The only regret I have is that this vehicle is no longer available new. (My soap box moment). AS HARD AS IT MIGHT TO BELIEVE BY U.S. CAR MANUFACTURERS, THERE IS A MARKET FOR MINIVANS IN THIS COUNTRY,And not everyone wants, or needs an SUV. This is evidenced by all the minivans with foreign (import) brand names running around. But, alas, I guess the U.S. just can't compete in this market any more. (either !). P.S. I only gave this vehicle four stars because it's used.",1
Very solid vehicle and fun to drive. Highly recommended.,1
"Ive had 4,  90s suburbans. All 1500 series.  From 96-99. I currently have a 97 2wheel drive. They are great for family or hauling stuff. Very roomy, plenty of storage space.  Gas mileage isn't the best. Isnt the worst either. They have their known problems, brake lines, fuel lines, fuel pumps,transmissions after about 150k. But once rebuilt, good for along time.but if you keep up the maintenance on them, they will last for a very long time.  Id rather put my money in my retirement than spend big $$$$ on a payment.",1
It was a very good car. Dependable and reliable.,1
"Solid, dependable truck that is low frills. I did not need the diesel or want to spend the 8k plus to have one plus expensive maintenence costs. 6.2 V8 has good power and get 14 mpg just driving around. Go get one if a steel body, V8, solid axles, vinyl interior appeal to you. If you want fancy options, get a Lariat.",1
"Well few things should be added and included is handles above the front and back doors for easier way to get in also transmition  sounds funny ones in while when shift from park to R and R to D ,stock radio is ok but could be better at least include hands free for all Journeys GPS would also come handy for ppl that travel all the time like myself.",1
"Great SUV, lots of power when needed,gas mileage not that great but not a concern, After all these years, my transmission blew & had to be replaced but it's better than buying a new car!",1
Great runner when it is running. Still more reliable than most newer vehicles regardless of their make and model.,1
"Sporty, fun, and with a lot of guts.  At 15 years old and 188,000 miles it still runs great!",1
Excelent car,1
Reliable solid truck,1
Has a nice interior and rides comfortably. Eonon dvd player radio is a must have.,1
"Curious that Amazon will let you eview a car. I really like my 2008 Malibu LS. I have had very few issues with this vehicle after 104k miles, and most of them have been quite minor. Yes, the TPMS went out long ago (I don't really care to pony up the funds just to know my tire pressure from the dash), and the power door locks are starting to struggle, but with the latter being my biggest gripe I think this vehicle is holding up excellently.

I did need a new catalytic converter at 92k which would normally be unacceptable considering the cost, but apparently mine was in a limited run of underperforming converters and qualified for replacement long after the normal warranty - replaced by a dealer for free!",1
best answer for someone who wants a great car that rides like a new one if is has been taken care of! Best for the buck in cars that last!,1
"Solid car! Great power and handling. The only problem I had was that the radio died after 6 years. Even though a broad, known issue, VW refused to replace them for customers. However, would definitely buy another VW Jetta!",1
Installation was fairly easy,1
"Wife loves her2008 Camry, 96,000 miles not a single problem. The only thing I can say is check the oil more frequently after 60,000 miles due to oil consumption. She gets her oil changed every 3months .",1
"All around great vehicle for the family. Lots of room to carry baggage, and people.  The rear seat is comfortable for adults too.
We had a 2011 Flex Limited AWD Eco-Boost, which we liked even more. The 2011 was involved in an accident, where it was totaled, but it held up very well.  Our new to us 2013 SEL FWD is just as nice, but I REALLY miss the twin turbo charge Eco-Boost engine.  If you plan on buying a FLEX, get the Eco-Boost. You won't regret it.",1
I live in North eastern Pennsylvania where we get quite a bit of snow having the all wheel drive heated seats and remote start comes in handy also its comfortable handles more like a car than suv I only wish the engine had a little more power,1
I would recommend power stop brakes rotors and calipers other then that I like my truck fords breaks seem to hang up when you only use the truck part time,1
"Great car... smooth ride, plenty of power, great value",1
Good performances,1
Great car hasn't done me wrong just too many repairs in the last year,1
"I like my Tundra. It's comfy, reliable, but not the workhorse my F-250 was. Gets overloaded pretty easily, and gets crappy gas mileage, but my work is all local, so not a problem. I would buy this truck again",1
Great SUV. Expensive on some repairs but very reliable. I have 180k miles on it and it is my daily driver. Changed the timing belt at 120k miles and no major issues.,1
Good car.,1
"Not a regular 944.  Those are not worth the effort, too slow and expensive.  A turbo, a 951.  Turbos are worth saving. They react well
to owners that understand their quirks and are not afraid to get their hands dirty.  Well sorted and chipped its a five and half second car
that can battle modern traffic with ease.  Parts costs for regular 944 items are not bad and there's a lot of dicumentation on these cars, they made 160,000 total 944s.  951 specific parts get pricey.  Keep a spare dme relay and lots of oil on hand.",1
"Nice size truck never cut off on me,great in snowy weather too. All power Everything and great heated leather seats.just hate the bouncy ride on long travels.",1
"Great car, great performance. I love it. 600 miles to a full tank on highway. City drive not so great",1
"Great Truck!!, I love its engine I had one with 4.6 displacement. Like all Ford Vehicles they need constant maintenance, nothing major but all the little stuff, If you're not bothered by it  then I fully recommended.",1
All jeeps should be Jurassic Park themed and not complying is undeserving of a full 5-Stars (including me),1
"This car hasn't done me wrong. Great on gas, alot of sitting space and trunk is roomy.",1
Very fun vehicle to drive; Its my daily driver and hunting buggy. I purchased several years ago used. I've went thru almost everything on buggy and either repaired or replaced. Still is factory vehicle and not cut up or chopped.  I constantly get questions as to what it is and if its for sale. Its my SAMMY.,1
"I bought this used. It was a one owner vehicle. I have done fuel injector cleaner and spark plugs. Just did a 1500 mile weekend with it, and it just gets better. 23mpg on the highway.",1
Had problems with leaky sunroof but keep cleaning out the weep holes and it will drain. Intake manifold had to be replaced. Other than that no major problems.,1
Overpowered with the 4.3 V6. Back end will fish tail on wet roads if not careful. If you are doing a V8 conversion you MUST add weight or modify the rear suspension accordingly.,1
"This car is perfect for our needs.  As a retired couple we don't need a large car but a sedan is somewhat too small for us as occasionally we need to move things that are too large for a sedan.  The only thing that we are not comfortable with is the front of car doesn't have much storage room for keys, phones, etc.
Overall though car performs well and we love it.",1
Excellent working vehicle but lacks soundproofing so road noise is farily obvious.,1
"Love my vehicle, it performs well, it has alot of space  for traveling and its very reliable in snowy weather.",1
No major problems just normal repairs brakes-tires,1
"I love driving this car, it's a complete toilet but I love it, it's nimble, I have fun in it, and it never left me stranded on the road no matter how hard the conditions got, as long as you take care of your engine with regular oil changes it will keep on going",1
Aggressive body style. Spacious interior. Roof rack is handy. 120VAC outlet that can be turned on and off on front console. Change between 2WD and 4WD on the fly. Pretty peppy from the line.,1
"Easy to work on, very durable, reliable and good on gas. That's why there are so many of them still on the road today. It's also why they are so hard to find parts for in the salvage yards.  Still trying to solve the infamous ""intermittent starting"" problem, though.",1
The only reason I'm dropping one of the stars is because if you're driving in the rain you can hear the water splashing up and making a very loud noise. So other than that they look awesome and hold my weight pretty good.,1
"I really like my Matrix XRS.  It has 120K miles and runs great.  I just replaced my second clutch.

The car has had issues with the brake calipers freezing up and ruining pads/rotors since it was new.  I have replaced the front brakes 5 times and the rear brakes 6 times.  This really runs into money.

The XRS is the performance model.  I still enjoy driving it after 11 years.  I would rate it 5 stars if not for the brake issues.",1
"My second MB C-class in 17 years.  This one I have for 6 years.  Excellent car and is heavy.  Solid drive, precise handling.  Very fast pick up with the V6 engine.  Gas mileage is so so, 23 mixed and 27 on the freeway.  My 1st C-class lasted 17 years and 200K miles.  Very low maintenance cost for the first 10 years, just once per year.  Plan A is about $150 and Plan B around $450.  No need for oil change within the year.  I'm in California so can't comment on snow road handling.  Don't like the lack of bluetooth audio, the 2008 model just have bluetooth phone, other than that nothing much to complain.  I always feel safe driving it.",1
"Love my 1999 CR-V, could use another 25-50hp though.",1
Quiet smooth ride.,1
"It has 186,000 miles and counting and it's a god damn miracle it's still alive but somehow it keeps going",1
Excellent,1
"Great tough little mountain goat. tows easily behind my motorhome, gets good mileage and is dependable...if you buy one be sure and find one with manual hubs and transfer case if you want to tow it",1
"Great vehicle. Smooth ride, easy to maintain. There was a recall in 2012 for a bad gas tank that would spit out gas when I filled it at the pump, but easy to get fixed at dealer. Then there's the sailcloth top... I was warned when I got the Wrangler by friends that it would eventually leak and never be fully leak-proof. That's true. I've spent over %500 at the ldealer fixing it, and it still leaks. Not a ton, but the floorboards get wet everytime there's a heavy rain. It's apparently part of the ownership experience, and you just learn to deal with pulling up the carpet, opening up the floor drains, and drying it out. It's a trade off for the awesome feeling of driving with the top down :)",1
One of the best vehicles that GMA have came out with. Drive wonderfully. Great on gas,1
Wife said she never own a minivan but we got her this Odyssey years back and she couldn't go without since. A MUST for family's with multiple children and always on the go!!,1
"Good motor, but I just turned the clock over to 160,000 miles and the tranny is starting to fail. It has had some heavy loads but not anything crazy in general. Transmission shop said the torque converters fail because the shift in and out constantly making them wear out. A Chevy thing. Anyway the said that it's not worth it to pull it out fix the torque converter and then not do the tranny. I trust these guys they have done a lot of work for me. Anyway the beef it up and put in a new valve body that doesn't allow it to shift as much. Over all a good truck. Great 4x4.",1
"It's a great car but does have issues with the trunk latch, breaks easy and for apparently no reason. Also if you have a blowout, you will probably have to buy a new tire pressure monitoring sensor. They don't hold up very well. Great engine and transmission, full of power..",1
"Great truck; a real workhorse but comfortable. I wish mine had the third door to more easily load cargo in the back seat. More modern brakes would be a plus, too, as would gauges that actually gave information. But overall, I don't miss having huge digital displays. My mechanic and his family have all owned and still own, this truck, which in itself says a lot. Naturally, I've had to replace parts rusted out or otherwise reaching the end of their useful life ( A/C, starter motor, etc.) but in general a very reliable vehicle. Economical compared to new truck prices, even with somewhat lower fuel economy (between 15 and 20 mpg)",1
"Vehicle has proved to be reliable.  The long lived 3.8L series engine is tough.  We are high mile drivers and have higher expectations of a vehicle's performance.  This is the 3rd 3.8L series engine we've owned and trust it completely.  As for the frame itself, the body is still tight.  It has a sports car feel to the steering and corners well.",1
"No engine problem since buying it in 2007 but had problems with mounts, bushings and shocks after 8 years.",1
Have had this car for 13 years and only recently started to have issues with the motor.,1
Bought a 10 year old car in 2015 with less than 40k miles.  Love the ride.  Like your living room.  But have been plagued my evaporative emissions light after $1000+ to fix it.  I know it looks like I have a crap mechanic.  But he does have a long history of good.,1
"Performance and reliability are nearly perfect.  Nothing to complain.  However, the alternator is likely to die young because of the engine heat.",1
"Great ride, no problems with it at 160000 miles, the biggest down side is the rust around the rear wheels and the cab corners",1
Have used fords for the majority of my driving experence. Have owned other brands but have always returned to fords. This brand has not given me to many problems.,1
Great van. Having little problems here and there,1
Price and not a complete fit as advertised,1
"Bought it used with 107,000 miles on it great condition with only things wrong with it was driver's window motor, and gas gauge.purchased on Dec 11 2016",1
"For an older model car, it's been reliable.",1
Great car and you can't beat the warranty! Just wish they would add a 6 cylinder option.,1
"This is my 4th Escort. I had a 1987, 1994, 1995 and now and probably the last 1998.
They are good little cars that are cheap and run well and are good on gas.
My all of mine were manual transmissions.
My 1998 is a SE Sport model 5 speed stick and gets about 35 mpg with most of my driving being highway.
I run about 36,000 miles a year commuting to work. They are easy to work on and parts are available and reasonable.
My 1998 was given to me by a friend after it was parked for 8 years and I was able to get it running again.
Not the most classy automobile, but if you are looking for a cheap ride it doesn't hurt to check one of these out.
The only knock I have on the Escort is the engine uses a timing belt instead of a chain and needs to be periodically replaced.
The older Escorts in the 80's if they snapped a belt it would demolish the engine, but the 1995 and up won't , but you'll be waiting for the tow truck.",1
"Awesome car, great on gas, space-full and looks good.
May be a little too slow for my liking, and has electrical issues from time to time.",1
"Love the car, disappointed in stereo speaker vibration and the interior integrity on the driver side door.",1
"Great fuel economy for such a large and heavy SUV.  While driving it it's hard to tell it's so heavy.  Comfy ride,  excellent audio although the optional iPod adapter won't charge unless you buy a charge option.  The optional blue tooth adapter that lists for $495 won't transmit music or map audio from iPhone and there is no way to activate Siri without touching your phone.  This was the last year before blue tech so none of the related complaints.  The black window sills we're losing their clearcoat so I covered them with the stainless kit from Amazon.  They look great. I did have a sagging airbag take out the air ride compressor.  I also had a swirl motor destroyed by an oil drip from the turbo.  Other than that it's been great.",1
"When it works, it's great. COPs are a lousy idea once the vehicle gets older and you have to start replacing one every 6 months and the blend doors on these break. Monster hassle to replace because you have to pull the dash out to get to it. Plenty of power with the 5.4 and they ride great. That's the only reason we kept it.",1
"Paid $200 for it, and it runs like a top, got over a quarter million miles on it!",1
"Great Vehicle. Good engine. Easy to work on. Original DOHC engine has inherent head gasket issues, Once they are replaced, it is trouble free.
My only issue is seat travel. I am only 5'11"", but have long legs. Cannot move the seat back far enough to be comfortable for long drives.",1
My 93 Honda Accord was sitting on HWY. 23 during the flood early 2017.  It was completely submerged in water and still runs great. I think it is because  being a pre-1996.,1
"Always wanted one for a long time and got a great deal on it, has very good space smooth ride and good power.",1
Best car I have ever own.,1
"I've had several Ford's, Chevys and a GMC over the years. The Ford's are by far the most dependable, the GMC left me stranded, one of the Chevys left me stranded multiple times. The Ford's were reliable every morning. They've had their problems just like any vehicle that gets beat on every day, but they give you signs that they're in need of something. Keep the service up and you won't be disappointed. Try to get the 5.4 motor instead of the 4.6, better transmission and more pep.",1
"Obviously I liked it enough to buy it. I bought mine certified pre-owned with aftermarket tint. So far the maintenance has been minimal and the car has been reliable. I do not own the Turbo version. I am 6'6"" and it is a bit cramped with someone in the back seat, and I am unable to have a booster seat or car seat behind me, because of the angle of my kids legs on the deep seat. I am able to sit up straight with the seat lowered to the floor. My wife and I love the heated front seats and the leather interior is very comfortable. The heat is temperature controlled, however you cannot just set it to hot or cold, you have to turn the dial to a certain temperature to get the desired affect. The auto climate control is great in the summer, but the heater doesn't really kick on well in the winter (you have to manually turn it up). The motor that pushes the heat to the back of the car is not overly strong, if I want it to work well I have to close the front vents. The Blue Tooth works well for phone calls with most phones, some it does not pair with, and you cannot play music over it. The USB charger is incredibly under powered and throws an error every time I plug my phone in. I have never once been able to get the phone book to work. I also have never figured out the navigation, although I haven't looked too hard since I have Google Maps. I do not pay for OnStar or XM Radio, but occasional get sales calls from them through the car. The car is fast, but the initial acceleration is delayed (the gas pedal isn't the most responsive initially), however, once you get the car rolling it picks up speed fast. It is an incredibly smooth ride so often times I find myself creeping over the speed limit. The manual shifting is not very responsive, you tell it to shift and then have to wait a second or two before it actually shifts. The paint is swirled and scratches easy... something I have noticed with other Regals when I look at them in the parking lot. I have even tried the whole Turtle Wax Kit for black cars. The wheels are extra wide (SUV sized) and can be a little annoying to find a replacement for them. I had to buy special tires for the winter, but it seems to handle fine after that. You have to take a bunch of things a part just to change the front headlights, one guy recommended going in through the wheel well, I just paid my local dealer to do it (only cost me the price of bulbs). If the oil is even a tiny bit low it will start to tick, well before the light comes on. I changed the brake pads and rotors myself, front and back, it was just like any other car. I have listed a lot of the negatives, but overall it is the best car I have ever owned. I love the design of this model, which has changed with the newer versions. It does not look like a 6 year old car, it looks very modern and turns peoples heads (similar to how the Lucerne still looks modern). It seems to get really good gas mileage over all, in the upper 20s. It has a really big gas tank, so even though I drive an hour every day for work I fill up less than once a week. I will definitely consider a Buick again for my next car, maybe a Lacrosse for the added room. There is no rust yet, I do store it in a garage, however, there are some tiny rust flakes in the chrome / steel accents that I need to buff out.",1
good,1
Everything I needed for the motor was there for a low price,1
"Love it; 'Cept F/ Some ""GM"" issues, It's perfect !!",1
had minor issues with bluetooth and stereo that never could get resolved to my satisfaction but the car and engine have held up well through the years.,1
"Love the truck.....but I'm not thrilled with the super cab. The doors make it difficult to place items in the back seat. Also, the sound system has an intermittent problem. It sounds like a speaker is bad and maybe but isn't always there. When I took it to the dealer, they couldn't hear it, of course.",1
I love  it!,1
"This is the third one I've had, and they all go through wheel bearings like crazy",1

"I traded in my JKU at 67,000 miles. During that time my jeep was in the shop twice besides maintenance . Once for bad battery and another for accident. It was the most reliable vehicle i ever owned. My only issue is the driver seat position. The lack of lumbar support left my back fatigued after long drives. And off center seat placement gave me shooting pain up and down my right thigh and right side of lower back. Ive never owned another vehicle to do this. I also travel alot for work and have rented all sorts of cars and trucks and not one that i can recall caused this. Since the jeep was my road trip vehicle to go camping and such i finally caved and traded it in for a Land Rover LR4.",1
"My wife and I shopped around quite a bit before pulling the trigger on our 2017 F-Pace S purchase with virtually all the boxes checked.  After reading through the other reviews here and a year behind the wheel, I can confirm a few things and update others.  First off, with an MSRP of ~$72K, the S is expensiveno doubt about.  However, for the performance and size, at least for us it nailed the goldilocks sweet spot far better than the Porsche Macan or Mercedes GLC models which we found to be the closest competitors.  Both those other makes are smaller, esp. in the cargo area, and while some of their models offer greater performance (GTS, Turbo, AMG), you pay substantially more for it.

The competitions larger offerings, Cayenne and GLE, get far more expensive if you try and reach a similar level of performance. Oh, and the F-Pace SVR is just about to hit the road if you need even more zoom with 550hp!  Bottom line: we absolutely love our purchase.  However, that won't stop me from nitpicking at what could be improved.

Pros
- Damn sexy as many have said.  We went with the British Racing Green paint and its as unique on the road as the vehicle it coats.  We stuck with the Ss standard 20in wheels which (I think) manage to fill out the arches just fine.  I do wish I would have opted for the equivalent black rims thoughjust to take the badassery to level 11.  Regardless, my personal opinion is the F-Pace simply has more presence on the road than its competitors (although Porsches quad running lights are pretty slick).
- Driving dynamics are incredible and utterly belay the size.  I hunt for curvy roads just to turn her loose every chance I get and inevitably my cheeks hurt from smiling so much.
- Love the option to display the navigation map on the dash.  That, along with the available HUD, means your eyes have to stray little from the road ahead.
- Incredible sound system (radio and exhaust)!
- Interior lighting system may be somewhat gimmicky but the ability to change the LED lines (which are everywhere by the way) to about a dozen different colors is pretty cool.  The kids squeal when I put it in sport mode turning everything angry red and swapping the tach for the speedometer front and center.
- Decent ground clearance means this vehicle, which can leave many dedicated sport cars in the dust, also has some respectable off-road chops.  Youre probably not going to follow Jeeps into the Mojave but the range of capability folded into a single vehicle is still pretty incredible.

Cons
- Interior: What the hell Jaguar?!  Yes, it has clean lines that should age well (similar to Audi) but the materials scream bargain basement considering the overall cost of the vehicle.  Things get better as you move up the model tree but not much.  JLR did significantly better with the slightly newer, similarly priced Velar so they are clearly capable of more.  We were also frustrated by the interior options as you worked your way up the models.  The RS versionpreviously one model tier down with a smaller supercharger on the 3.5L producing 340hp (thats no longer offered)had about 10 color schemes to choose from.  However, bump up to the S, and you're suddenly down to 3 (4 now).  The ONLY difference we could ascertain was an S was stamped into the 2 front seats; other than that, the seats and interior layout appear identical.  We settled on boring-black because the brown looks too masculine (according to the wifeand probably right) and the red waswellA LOT of very bright red.  A willingness to pay more should increase your optionsnot decrease them.
- The infomant system (sigh).  After THREE software updates, the quirks remain.  Occasionally we turn on the vehicle and the radio decides it won't work.  Other times, the cameras and/or the other parking sensors won't functionapparently just because it isn't in the mood.  Its also now 2018 and we still don't have support for Apple CarPlay and Google Auto.  What I wouldnt give to integrate Waze in for longer road trips  Configuring display of the exterior cameras could be executed better as well.  We also have an Infiniti; they just do it better where it takes one button push to activate the forward camera as you're creeping into a spot you want forward vision on.
- Storage bin space is pretty pathetic; not sure where it went considering this is a sizable SUV.  The JLR rotary shifter is a neat feature but it takes up far too much space in the center console.  Since this design doesnt give you the option to shift in a manual fashion (and you have paddles anyway), Id think it would be better integrated up into the dash freeing up precious space below.
- Unlike one author here, I don't feel the phone app is all that bad.  However, I do agree with his assessment that remote start should be replicated on the key fob.  The app often forces you to re-login making the process unnecessarily cumbersome; esp. since the car will occasionally also then just sit there until you are almost on top of it before starting as though the start request had to route around the moon.
- The wave your foot under the rear bumper to open the hatch when your hands are full is a joke.  It works about 1 in 8 times leaving you the rest of the time looking like an idiot.",1
"Over all a great car , Mine is the 4MATIC Wagon . rides great , The only issue I have is the Emission/Smog passing Issue. other than that few minor things here and there .  Got the car for great price and it was in excellent condition and still is ,  for the money you really cant beat it .",1
"Its like a go kart from hell, accelerates pretty quick and can take turns like a champ. You don't see many of them around, and modified they turn some heads. Its also simple and easy to work on. The only cons are that the inside is very small and its a little clumsy when it comes to snow.",1
Not a perfect car but you cannot get a better Value for your money than with the SRT 8 / 2006 Model! Just get in and Drive going No Where!,1
"Had this car since new.  18 years and still looks good and my wife drives it daily,  175,000 miles.  Trick to any VW product is to religiously follow the owners manual and service requirements",1
Super reliable and still runs great after putting a 150K miles on it!,1
"It is a perfect size that even my wife likes to drive, I would have given it a 5 star rating had I gotten a 4 wheel drive version. It is not good in snow because it is so light. Glad to hear Ford is bringing the Ranger back in 2020",1
The vehicle is off closed.  all sudden alarm clocks ..will the second it off stay other rain off of time,1
Decent car. 4 cylinder consistently gets 31 mpg. The intermediate shaft is the only real issue I've had with the car. I replaced it with the Dorman product and it remedied the knocking sounds in the steering.,1
It's a nice travel van. Chevy's design in the engine compartment leaves a lot to desire. Plastic heater hose connection breaks about every two years and the shifter connector the same.,1
"this is my husband's truck and it has over 250,000 miles and is still trucking!",1
Great car but not very good on gas mileage.,1
"Love the truck, since day one. The only minimal issues while it was young, was the intercooler issue. Ford fixed under recall issues. Goes through plugs quick due to the turbos. After installed Livernois programmer, that thing is stupid fast for a factory ride. For anyone who knows 1/4 mile times, 14.09 with just a programmer, no intake or exhaust. Beat 5.0's, RT's and a few others that night that were running upper 14's. Daily driver and have over 180k on it. Only draw back, Fords not excellent brakes. One day, maybe a good upgrade.",1
"I've had very good experience with Ford Bronco's - as long as you maintain them. Had an '89 Eddie Bauer and my ex-husband managed to turn it in from a V8 to a V7. It still ran. You can do that by not checking engine oil level. When the ex had it - no oil changes, he never added oil either. My favorite - he ran it with differentials locked in at highway speeds 55-70mph. Yup, he dogged it. It still ran but, transmission started slipping. My '96 doesn't have those issues it's maintained could use a paint job. The previous owner cut off most of the wiring harness??? That's OK, didn't need that airbag or cruise control as long as it's driveable and the seat belts work.",1
"Great car. Drives well with a reliable motor. Ease of maintenance and styling are 2nd to none.
Interior plastic pieces are old enough to start breaking so take care.",1
"Pros: Very comfortable ride, beatiful styling, standard technology, low maintenance.

Cons: RWD alignment issues(negative camber), cannot rotate tires due to different side from front to rears, vinyl leather driver side seat started cracking at approximately 60-70k miles. Components that failed (Fuel pump, cooling thermostat, ignition coils, ball joints). Trunk electrical wire design flaw. Brown power wire fatigued and separated causing no power to trunk motor, third break light and license plate lights.",1
NICE ROUGH RIDE,1
GREAT TRUCK,1
"Owned the Jeep for 16 years.  The basic transportation aspects are fine and functional over the years.  Problem areas have been:  radio, electric windows, a/c (constant and expensive problems), and tie rods and ball joints.",1
"I bought this car used at a local lot two years ago. You can tell it was used by Grandma or an older person; there's none of the normal detritus from serious family use with young kids. Even now, when I take out the seats, there are no stains or stuff rubbed into the carpet. I bought it with 155K miles on it, we now have 169K miles. We've used the car to haul six people and stuff to ball games and the like. The dual power doors and the rear a/c still work perfectly. I use it more like a pickup truck; the only real disappointment I've had is with the cargo area. I found that it cannot load a complete 4' x 8' sheet of paneling without part of it hanging out of the back. On the other hand, we used it this year to move to a smaller house, this thing took multiple loads of stuff to the storage unit, various charities and ultimately to our new home, without problems. If I'm honest, the reason why this car is so good is that the original owner(s) took good care of it. Had this thing been treated like many other minivans, I'm sure it would have more issues than it does.

But, the overall size is fairly handy, you can stuff a lot of people into it, or a lot of stuff. The engine in this one is in good condition other than the crappy gaskets that GM used to install back in the day. I don't believe this one has had head gasket issues, but the valve cover gaskets leak. I'll have to address that soon.  It drives like a bigger car, with a higher center of gravity and all that it affects. The steering and braking are good for a car of this era, but with newer cars that have all disc brakes, the braking on this car now leaves a little to be desired. I get about 19 MPG in mixed driving, biased more toward stop and go traffic. That's usually about 400 miles out of a tank of fuel. Replacement part costs don't seem excessive, but this is a fairly old design now; the version of this van was released in 1997(?), and anyone in the US can work on the generic GM mechanical bits, inexpensively, too.

If you find yourself in a position to pick up one of these that has been taken care of, I would do it. Inexpensive to own and run. I would have serious reservations against making it a front line duty vehicle for a family, mostly due to the age of these vehicles now. Even when they were new, they weren't particularly good in crash tests. If I were getting a van for family use, the 2005 and later GM vans are much safer. Other newer vans have far more safety features added, like a more rigid structure, four wheel disc brakes and more airbags. But for me, this van is fine.",1
"YOU KEEP THIS MAINTAIN ANY NO PROBLEMS AFTER 170,000 MILES",1
This truck has been loyal to me for 14 yrs! There have only been minor maintenance things and some warranty items that need doing during it's tenure so far. It's part of the family!,1
"Excellent gas mileage. My only complaint is the air conditioner compressor failed with only 60k miles. The dealership wanted $1265.00. I purchased a compressor online, received ontime and had my mechanic replace it which saved me hundreds. Up until now, I had all routine maintenance done at a Toyota dealership.
Original tires need replacing but at 60k miles it is about average.
I am fully satisfied with the performance of the Camry except for the compressor and the price the dealership wanted to replace it. However, if I would probably purchase another Camry, I would let my mechanic do the maintenance after the 24000 mile check up.",1
I love this truck! I only wish it had power seats with a height adjustment and a built in garage door opener.,1
"My car has 193,000 miles on it and still going strong.  Not beautiful, not even very comfortable, but reliable and decent gas mileage.  Perfect for a get to work and back car, no car payments, and pl/pd insurance.",1

The 2003 Dodge Caravan is a Workhorse. I believe it is more depending than the average vehicle. Ever notice how many are still on the road?,1
"Last of the full frame truck-style Pathfinders.  It's built like a tank and drives like one too, just the way I want it.  I bought this used in 2013 with 22K on it.  It has 78K now.  I have a bunch on nuisance things that are going wrong, hence the 4 stars. Good for an old school guy that doesn't mind fixing your car.  Bad for a person that wants everything to work perfectly.  Maybe it's just mine.

Gas mileage and a test ride would tell you what you're getting.  Don't buy it if you want a smooth, quiet ride.  Buy it if you want to haul, stuff it full of skis, bikes, or hockey equipment.  Bash it around a bit and never worry about getting stuck in the snow.",1
"A good car, spoilt by the MMI system that uses dated technology.  Not a patch on the Ford SYNC system.  Too many flashing warning lights, false alarms and interlocks that tend to reduce the driver to a mindless robot.  This is the Prestige model.  There are some cost cutting features as compared to my previous 2006 Avant.  OEM brake pads eat up the rotors and make lots of black dust on the wheels.  Replaced pads with Akebono ceramic - big improvement.",1
Excelent,1
Is the best car drove like space on the car all futures is the best.,1
Good car. Not the most stylish but its nice.,1
"107,000 mi and still running strong!",1
I got this truck about four years ago and it has been reliable ever since. To this point the biggest issues I have had with this truck is I had to replace the starter twice. After I got that straightened out though there have been no major issues. With this truck being as old as it is I am very impressed with how it has held up. I have owned other vehicles that were built around this same time (by a different OEM) that were no where near as reliable. All and all it is a well built American truck that will get the job done.,1
overall a great little truck.  Two issues I have is that the front seat is not adjustable enough and the steering column does not telescope.  On other thing is the gas mileage is a little low I'm getting 18.5 and in a small truck like this I would expect 21 or more.,1

"Original owner 07/1997. 171000 miles. Vehicle was payed fro in 2000. Over last 12 yrs have averaged about 100.00 per month on repairs and replacements. Regular maintenance not included. Very reliable vehicle. Have had transmission rebuilt at abt 80K. Regular adjustments since then no problems. Have replaced the alternator twice, Original starter replaced recently. Air conditioner major repair recently, only recharge prior to that. Replaced all of the upper engine seals recently due to oil leaks from top end. Did have issue with cruise control at one time, turned out to be faulty brake sensor caused surge at low speed.  Excellent tire ware. Not much plastic in the vehicle. It pays to repair rather than to replace in this case. Switched to 20/50 oil at abt 100k miles. Does not burn oil to any extent. Maybe 1 qt. in 5 or 6K miles. All of the paint is original except hood.. Paint on this vehicle is superior.",1
"The 1999 Chevrolet Astro is a great vehicle. It was available with a 4.3 liter vortec engine. The mini-van also was available in either rear wheel drive or all-wheel drive (AWD).  There are some downsides to the vehicle. Maintenance can be a real challenge on the vehicle. Where changing the air filter, oil filter, fuel filter and oil are straight forward...access to the spark plugs can be a real challenge. The vehicle is known for developing a window/roof leaks. Also, I have gone through many idler arms. Other common problems are very dirty a/c condenser in front of the radiator causing overheating, bad EGR valves, and fouled O2 sensors.",1

"Solidly built car with no major repairs in 160,000 miles. I live in Texas where stone chips to paint and windshield are common. The paint and glass seem to chip a little too easily. Not a real quiet car with road noise.",1
"I may be a little harsh on this rating because it has been a very reliable vehicle.  The only problem I had, which Acura fixed, was the software in the transmission was not working properly when I first bought the car.  Like I said Acura took care of it.  The transmission does shift a little hard at times which is a little bothersome.  Other than that and a rattle or two, the car is now 6 years old with close to 100K miles, it has been a very good car overall.  The paddle shifters make it fun to drive when needed.  It has pretty good power.",1
I lover my jeep the only thing I am dissatisfied with his the door hinges they start to rust long before the car will I wish they would  recall and replace the hinges replace him with better hinges,1
"The Envoy is essentially a TrailBlazer, but with a twist.  The XUV version has a retractable hardtop and something called a midgate that allows sectioning off the cargo area behind the rear seats.  As a result, it is still somewhat narrower than, say a Suburban, but about as long.  By rolling (sliding) the rear roof section forward, and raising the midgate glass, you have a vehicle muich like the current Honda Ridgeline.  Roof plus all windows including midgate and tailgate are all electric, so no manual operation here.  Two bucket seats in front, a wide split bench behind, and an open cargo area in the back.  Seats are Firm but comfortable, even on a long run. The XUV  was a great idea, but was only produced from 2004 to 2006. Except for the unique parts involved with the midgate, tailgate, rear roof and taillight assemblies most of the other parts are the same as a Trailblazer of the same year..  After folding the rear seats, the midgate folds down, leaving a large, completely flat cargo area.  The tailgate opens from one side (hinged at one end, opening sideways like some of the Ford station wagons) or down  like a conventional tailgate.  There is a stabilizing rod that can hold the tailgate at two levels, one flat with the floor of the cargo area, and one that is higher to support 4x8 sheets of plywood.  Several tiedown loops are featured in the cargo area so you can secure whatever you are haulling.  With the midgate up, you can hose out the back cargo section without hurting anything.  The cargo floor is ""corrugated"" like a typical pickup bed. Most of these came with the optional rug in the cargo area.
Oh, and there was also an option of a ""tent"" affair that snaps to the rear to turn the vehicle into a camper.
Runs and drives well, even with the I6 (inline six cylinder) engine. 4.2L is more than enough horsepower to push this down the road in a respectable manner, though a 5.3 L v-8 was also available.  Transmission is a 4L60e, which works well and is durable. Switchable 4 wheel drive (2wd, 4wd auto, 4wd and 4wd low) without getting out to take care of front hubs, and a locking rear axle make it a decent off-road SUV. Real 4wd with high and low transfer case, not the typical ""full time 4wd"" of many suv type vehicles.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fuel mileage.  I typically get about 16.3 to 16.7 MPG, whether I run relatively short trips (10 to 30 miles) or longer runs (120 miles each way) with the I6.  Other owners I've talked to had similar mileage with the V-8.  My wife  isn't a great fan of the long wheelbase, she prefers the shorter wheelbase of her early Honda Pilot.
Easily noted on the road by the longer length, full rear passenger doors that aren't cur for the rear tires, a roof rack and unique taillights.  I was surprised to see at least 4 other ones in Hilo, Hawaii, near where I live.",1
Love my truck.,1
"I bought mine brand new and still have it 20 years later.  It has treated me pretty well overall and I've beaten on it some, although only put 140k on the ODO.  I have always liked shifting my own gears and this was still an option in '98, so I got the NV3500 behind the little ol' 318 (5.2l for your wannabe euro folks).

Gripes:
3.55:1 gears with only 230hp.  I have admittedly made this issue worse by going up one size in tires but the darn thing is sure not a puller!  This is made even WORSE by the nearly 1400 RPM jump between 2nd and 3rd gear.  I have threatened to put 4.10 gears in the thing for years...don't recon I'll actually get to it now.

CAD....one of the stupidest things Dodge and Chevy ever did!  A $200 4X4 posi-loc kit early on took car of this issue though when the stupid vacuum pot failed at 70k miles.

Pros:
In 20 years, I really haven't had to do much and it's been pretty darn reliable overall, even as much as it sits the last few years.  I added a K&N breather, JBA headers, and a series 70 Flowmaster to help it at least breath better so, by itself, it performs ok, even if I almost never get it in to 5th gear on our rural roads with that gearing.

I've had the pinkslip for YEARS!!!",1
"Purchased new in 2003. Still driving this. No engine issues have occurred, but have had to replace a windshield washer pump, both airbags, freebie, Driver side door lock no longer works. Issue with driver side seat belt and airbag light. All driving has been local so we only have put about 80000 on it in 14 years. Had to replace shocks, rotors and routine brake pads and a driveshaft. But overall maintenance cost/year has been low. We use this more like a truck and have hauled up to 1/2 ton although only rated for 700lbs. Weight was never an issue. We will run this as long as we can with reasonable maintenance. Overall the longest we have owned a vehicle. Also living in the Northeast most cars have rust issues after this amount of time. No issues other than some welding on the exhaust. All wheel drive goes through the worst Noreasters. Overall an amazing car.",1
"Excellent vehicle for those looking for something a little rugged. Great for off road trails yet suitable for the city commute. My only gripe is the gas mileage per gallon is just okay. Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars.",1
parts i purchased works great and i amgoing to order more great job!,1
Its an awesome product but was a little bit small on the back,1
"Ordered a mirror for our 2103 Ford E250. It was shipped in a reasonable time and fit great, Very easy install.",1
I have over 300000on my 06 Durango with a hemi engine took off head to replace a crank shaft senor and still looks likely came out factory clean have bone any engine work except a a senor and a considerable problem I have is with front brake pads going out in a short time,1
Very reliable car as long as you keep it up to date. Parts are expensive so if you are a DIY mechanic you will save thousands,1
"The injectors go out at 150,000 miles and the primer pump on the filter has to be rebuilt about every 100, 000 miles or less. The cost to replace the injectors is $3000.00 for parts and $1500.00 for labor. The primer pump rebuild kit is $30.00 dollars and takes about a whole day. These two items should have been fixed by Chevrolet a long time ago or they should have to replace these parts for free because it is poor quality equipment failure. The labor and parts should be free. The engine that I have is the Duramax LB7. Also when the injectors are replaced the glow plugs should be replaced at the same time. In replacing the injectors and glow plugs it will take a good shop two days to complete the job.",1
"Great car inexpensive parts, accesories and maintenance.

There is still a lot of stuff to buy here on amazon for this car",1
THERE AN OK CAR IF CHRYSLER IS THE BRAND OF CAR YOU WANT,1
We have over 160k miles and we keep running strong. This was a perfect people mover for our family.,1
"Reasonably comfortable and quiet ride for the era. Seats are amongst the best I've tried. Very sound mechanicaly speaking, only major problem you're likely to run into is body rust. Suspension could be better, body roll and understeer is dominant when cornering. Having much weight over the front wheels is beneficial driving up snowy hills however. Overall a cheap and reliable car I give it a solid 5/7",1
"I have had this car since new. Now 185,000 miles. Build quality is very high and interior materials particularly the seats and seat fabric still looks like new. Perfect size vehicle and prefer to newer larger size latest generation. Weak spots are brakes could be more powerful. Turning circle is poor but this mostly due to fring wheel drive architecture. Can't get rid of it as it feels like a set of comfortable slippers. Never let me down on the side of the road. Simple and functional.",1
"14' STX 4x4 w/ 5.0.

Likes: 5.0 is an amazing engine.  Lots of power and decent fuel economy for a truck after I installed a bed cover, cold air intake, cat back exhaust, and a tune.

The suspension is far superior to the 07 Sierra I used to own.  The back end doesn't kick out if I hit a bump while turning.  This truck gets fair traction in the snow, I've never had to use 4WD in it (the stock tires were pretty new the first 2 winters it's seen).

The interior is very durable, from the cloth seats to the plastic trim.  Compared to the Sierra, this interior is much tougher; but probably less pleasing to the eye.  Nothing is wearing out, the plastic is still the same color as it was a couple years ago and the seats still look like new.

Dislikes:  I'm by no means an audio snob, but I enjoy cranking up music during my commute.  The factory Ford stock stereo system is the sorriest factory setup I've ever listened to.  The speakers are garbage and the wattage the head unit puts out is aweful.  I absolute loathe Ford's basic audio systems.

The durable interior that I mentioned above comes with a price.  The seats are as hard as a rock.  I've sat on church pews that have more cushion.  (Perhaps upgraded interiors are different).  It's taken about 25,000 miles of my 300+lbs butt to break in the driver's seat.  This may be a plus for some of you.",1
Great gas mileage and overall awesome car,1
"Material, perfect. Color, perfect. No cut-out in back seat cover to accommodate seatbelt buckles.",1
Great little car with great gas mileage.,1
"lots of good features 4 wheel drive system works very good , only gripe is the small gas tank and the low miles per gallon but its worth the power of the vortec v 6",1
"Its really nice car from the past, but just don't forget, something constantly will go out
Not because it's Mercedes but because the years past.",1
That it came on time like they said,1
Yes,1
"It was okay for the time I had it. I purchased a used one in 2014 and drove it for about 20k miles. Nothing broke on it during that time except the thermostat got stuck open and battery started to die.
I did the maintenance and repairs on the vehicle myself which included transmission servicing.
I decided to sell it and get a cheap car while I am waiting for the Tesla Model 3 to come out.",1
Lots of power but maybe too much for the transmission. It gets good mpg when pulling. Love the 4 wheel drive.,1
like my car  only things I wish I had gotten the 6 cylinder model as I don't have much get up and go  The other thing I don't like is the positioning of the air conditioning vents.  otherwise great car  Have had no issues mechanically,1
Been a great truck!! Could use a little more horse power!,1
"Terrific vehicle, I would buy another if I could.",1
"I bought my 2004 Honda Accord EXL car from my son-in-law after my daughter passed. It was her car and she loved it. She bought it new and pampered it through the years, going so far as to change the oil more often than the recommended intervals. It had 58000 miles on it at at ten years of age when I bought it. Anything went wrong with it she had it fixed by the dealer.
Now that I have it I love it as well and continue her almost obsession with it. It still looks new at age twelve, except for the few dings and nicks you couldn't tell it from the present generation. The motor is quiet, powerful and the interior is comfortable. It gets decent mileage, up to 33 hwy, 25 city, and I intend to make this my last car. If Honda's reputation holds out It will probably outlast me. The next owner will be getting a fine car.
The only complaints I have with it is the harsh ride and road noise that enters the cabin from the tires meeting the road. Smooth roads, no problem. Chip and seal roads, and there are a lot of them, and the noise will drive you crazy. Grooved concrete and the singing is so bad if it goes on for a good distance you will need ear plugs, literally.
I have tried to mitigate some of the noise with Zbarting the underside, using soundproofing inside on the floor panels, spraying dampeners inside the door panels all to no avail. All I have now is a car that will never rust.
Even with those complaints I still love the car and plan on having it a long time.",1
Fun and easy to work on.,1
Not enough power..,1
I like my van. The engine runs great & it sure is a trooper.,1
"If this vehicle had 4WD instead of AWD (with a selector leaver) and had the shifter on the center console instead of the steering column, it would be a solid 5 star. What I really like is the interior room. It is a true mid-size vehicle. So far mine has been bullet proof with 120,000 miles on it.",1
"Bought this car in 2014 while attempting to look at a 2007 Mercury Montego. The Montego was sold and I was offered the Lucerne at a substantial discount. Even though it was $1,000 more than I wanted to spend I have been happy with. Leather seats that are heated in front, driver and passenger temperature controls along with plenty of rear seat leg room and trunk space are my favorites. While many have called it plain the car was for me as I am not a stand out in the crowd kind of guy. Smooth, very comfortable, and very quiet. The 3.8 V-6 is robust but not exhilarating. That said I do achieve 21 city / 27 hwy mpg very consistently. Problems have been few: front brake rotors were original and shimmied bad. Replaced the front rotors and pads with ceramic pads and rear pads with semi-metallic and it's been fine. The original heater hose elbows are made of plastic and eventually crack. Replaced them with aluminum elbows, changed the thermostat, serpentine belt, and tensioner pulley while I was in there. Also the door handles are pot metal coated in plastichrome. There are round holes on the inside of the handle that threaded studs are pressed into. The threads are pushed through the door panel and secured in place by washers and nuts. Over time the studs break loose of the holes they are mounted in (especially if the door is iced closed and you are tugging on it) necessitating the removal of the door panel to replace. There are videos on YouTube on how to do this and reinforce the holes that hold the studs. Honestly, I'd rather replace the heater elbows. Lastly the transmission thumps as you accelerate from a stop. If you accelerate very carefully it won't happen and then every once in a great while it will bang into gear as it shifts but then it goes away for months at a time. It even does it after a fluid flush. I've read that it is transmission sensors going bad. Either way this car has been very enjoyable. So much so that my wife has accosted and only wants to drive the Lucerne. I think maybe she has a new boytoy but she's always home when I get home so ...",1
I love the way it drives and love being sitting high. The disappointment is that it did not come with fog lights and I wanted them. They installed them at my cost but they look lovely.,1
"The Edge handles well, appears solid enough, has not had any major problems, replacement parts are not expensive - however changing the spark plugs on this engine takes a real effort and extensive time.",1
"great truck lots of power, pulls trailer with little effort. My only concern are the head studs on the 6.0 but 190,000 miles and no issue yet so I'm cautiously optimistic.",1
"Nice car, even with flaws. Corners between side windows and windshield are huge blindspots. Mine came with plastic ""awnings"" over the front windows which added to the blind spots so i had them removed. The suv does not feel as ""solid"" as my last suv, a rogue. It gets great mileage, low maintenance, easy to drive and park. I do not like the lip on the door frames, my arthritic knees have a hard time getting in and out, but compared to most other cars, this one is easy. It is roomy, sharp looking, plenty of head room. Could use some more leg space in the back. Love the extra storage space under the trunk floor.
All in all, a good buy for the money.",1
I wish I would have waited for the new model year. I like the 2015 Q7 very much but think the electronics are much more advanced in the newer model.,1
"when changing from reverse to drive ,the drive connetion isslow to engage to forward motion needs to be slack in gear pickup.",1
"Great car for my wife. Found ours low with mileage about 27000 5-6 years ago. Ours has been very good and reliable, with almost every upgrade availbe on it. Cons are i like to work on my own cars and some things that are easy on most cars are more difficult (like changing the battery).",1
"This truck is 19 years old with 164000 miles.  It has been very reliable for me and I like the ride.  I am expected 250,000 miles out of it.",1
I have a 328i convertible  fun car!,1
"Has been a no-surprises car, except for consistent transmission issues. At about a 3-4 month interval,  the transmission loses it's smooth shifting and hunts and delays between the gears. The deal has, until recently, fixed this under warranty, but now will not. Although this car's coming up on 14 years old, it only has 70,000 miles on it, and the warranty stopped at 60k. Also the passenger seat belt warning light just came on and they said the repair requires replacing the entire seat and they won't do that either.",1
"A great and reliable car.  Limosine like rear seating.  Comfortable with all safety tech.  But, not particularly fun to drive.  Not sure it is an improvement over the Camry, depending upon how its equipped but neither is it much more expensive.  The Camry being smaller handles better.",1
I like my Sienna and it is reliable but the road noise is terrible.  When on the highway it is very hard to hear the radio without blasting yourself out. I do also like being able to make sharp turns. Is comfortable and has lots of room.  Third row easily stows and resets.,1
"Well-built car and mine has over 450,000 miles on it and I am getting ready to scrap it because it needs some major transmission work and some engine work that is not worth putting money in the vehicle due to the age and the miles.  I have the same engine but will note that I went through alternators quite a bit.  Also, Infiniti service at dealerships are a rip off.  Better off dealing with a good mechanic.  Couple grand for changing 02 and knock sensors when I did not know better.  Never again.",1
"As long as u maintenance right this car will last u a long time, some interior parts were cheaply made but overall a good car especially on the freeway",1
"I have owned my Honda Odyssey for 10 years. I have never owned a vehicle over 2 years. My Honda still runs great and I am having a hard time replacing it. Plenty of room for everyone, no leg cramp for third row seating. My Honda has had 4 accidents hit on every side. This vehicle can withstand impacts. I pulled the middle seats out, folded down the back seats and fit a side by side refrigerator in the back and still had room to close the hatch. I feel this vehicle is so safe we are giving it to our 16 year old to drive.",1
Looks good and high quality.,1
These capable SUV's have a huge following believe it or not I own a xe/sp- sports package beige on beige they are very reliable you can put it to the floor every you go and get 3 mpg and it will start up every time never should leave you stranded if your looking for an SUV with alot of bolt on performance parts this is one lacks bolt on  parts for performance 2000-on up until the r52 are very upgradeable  but has a cloud like ride mash the gas and make here squat and take off at her own pace hahaha but I love it it's my first vehicle and I've done plenty upgrades one I recommend is one you can't see from pictures is the top auto accessorie OBD2 tuner follow the instructions it's alot more effective than the innovative tuner for 69$ I have both and they supposedly work together but they are counter productive together the top auto changes shift points and does save gas not much but the change in shift points is my favorite thing about it pics for the fun of it,1
great car....some electronic issues.. those are important as they are expensive to fix.  but too much fun to drive!!,1
"I had a Ford Ranger and have also serviced several Ford Rangers (3.0 and 4.0 liter)  Sadly, Ford stopped producing this truck in 2011. This is a great small truck and relatively simple to service. I know that Ford has a true double cab in Australia and in Mexico, it looks like a mini Ford Raptor! Dependable and long lasting, I've sen them go well over 250,000 miles with proper maintenance. We'll see when Ford decides to bring back this truck.",1
Well it's a great truck.,1
Good car hasn't given me troubles but of course i take care of it,1
A great little truck.  Underpowered with the 3.0L engine.,1
"Window regulator failures no longer covered by recall, front ball joint recall still in effect, free trailer hitch to fix gas tank recall still in effect.
Other than these issues, I like this vehicle a lot.",1
"Great family or sporty off road kinda car since its awd, just keep it maintenance its should always run great",1
Good first car for my son.,1
"It has a stock diesel with plenty of power. A little dissapointed in some of the electrical, although I have been able to repair all of the issues.",1
"A good rig. Handles great off road, just a tad too stiff for road. Not a good commuter but for a daily or trail rig, it's good. Aftermarket is widely supported with so many brands to go with for all kinds of mods and upgrades. I hated that they went to the button door from the hinged, I will never get used to it. Also, expect to have to slam your doors or have to try a few times because it does not latch easily. Roof panels are very easy to remove and put on which is great for those really hot days and you want to open up. Doors are a bit heavy and with the power group, the door cable can be a pain. Overall, a good rig and makes for a perfect summer daily driver.",1
"This car was one of the halo 200hp FWD Japanese imports of the time. It was heavier and slightly slower than the famed Integra Type-R, but it was a blast to drive. It came in two flavors: a base model and an SH. I have always felt it was visually a great car but suffered from a slightly too high ride height and bland stock aero. There was an OEM optional skirt kit that made the car look fantastic.

Interior:
- The ""Dough Boy"" four prong Accord like steering wheel was a quite bland and a little large for a sport coupe.
- Gauges were functional and classic but very 90's and a dull amber color.
- The seats were comfortable while still holding you in well. They were fine for longer trips too.
- The dash was simple, but well thought out.
- Ergonomics were thought out well; everything was well placed, more or less.
- Stock audio is pretty crappy.
- Window switches sometimes stop working. They simply get dirty. Buy new ones or clean the inner contacts.

Exterior:
- Aero was a little bland without the optional OEM kit; side and rear lips were unpainted on base models.
- The car was wide and low, making it stand out in traffic.
- Large flat and angular areas look great but make dings really stand out.
- Headlight tabs have a tendency to break.

Performance:
- The H22 was a fine motor that made decent power and torque. It's reliable and stout, timing belt (lack of chain) notwithstanding.
- The 5 speed manual transmission has been criticized for not being as reliable as it's B-series brother, but I never had any issues.
- The Automatic has a high failure rate. Get a manual.
- The cable operated shifting was very smooth. Honda made some of the best shifters back then. Could use a weighted knob though.
- The handling was absolutely fantastic, especially in the SH trim. The wide car was very well planted and very fun to drive.
- Being a FWD car, it did suffer from wheel hop on hard launches.
- Brakes were fairly standard, but stopped the car fairly well.

SH specifics:
The SH trim made this car feel like a RWD car, but came at a cost: complexity. Basically, there was a differential unit bolted to the transmission that could transfer torque electronically between left and right to a greater degree than even a classic LSD could. It used several yaw sensors throughout the car to achieve this. But there are issues with it:
- It does not respond well to extreme horsepower gains. The unit expects 200HP. Give it too much more and it will freak out some.
- The SH doesn't like changing direction quickly. So much power goes to the outside wheel that it felt I had to fight that on quick turn changes.
- The ATTS unit that does this takes up a lot of room: changing a clutch is obscenely difficult due to lack of space.
- The sensors can be a pain to get to to replace.
- If the ATTS unit breaks, your car will be stuck: there is no direct connection between the motor and transmission. It all goes through the ATTS unit.
- The ATTS also needs to be cooled. Lines go to the radiator.

Despite being older and FWD, I would still recommend this car as a daily driver or even a track car. Just make sure you get a base manual. The auto breaks and the SH really is not worth the hassle of maintenance.

Recommended Upgrades:
- AP1 S2000 Steering wheel swap. It's pretty easy and the airbag will work. Massive upgrade over stock boat steering wheel.
- Lower it an inch.
- Find OEM Option lip kit or add some tasteful aero; it will get some more air in the radiator too.
- Upgrade to 17 or 18 inch wheels with a wider track; there is plenty or room in the wheel wells and the stock tire track was a bit small.
- Get a weighted Shift knob. I recommend a 2003 Base RSX 5 speed aluminum knob.
- Install JDM spec fog-lights; there are several good and inexpensive options. USDM spec looked dumb.
- Upgrade to a Mishimoto all aluminum radiator. The stock plastic ones degrade over time and often crack.",1

"A great dependable vehicle, perfect for getting around urban areas and still having the capabilities of a truck.",1
"We picked up our 98 Van for our mountain bike team, it had 235k miles, it was in need of all basic maintenance parts but once that was taken care of the van has been great and we are using it daily now, small quarks like making sure you have spark plug grease on each plug and wire to the coil corrects any misfiring.",1
Good vehicle. Have had for 15 years. 170 k miles and still running strong. I have the ZR2 model. Biggest complaint is rust. GM should be ashamed of their poor rustproofing. Ball joints also a problem.  I gave this to my son 7 years ago and he loves it especially since  I still pay for all repairs.,1
The duramax lb7 does have its issues. But a good sturdy truck besides the injector problems,1
I THANK IT A VERY DEPENDABLE CAR AND IT RIDES REAL GOOD,1
"I love it!  Bought it used with high mileage and it now has 170,000!  Have not had any problems worth mentioning. Roomy, comfortable, love the hatchback.  Not 4WD... too bad, but otherwise have no complaints.  Am hoping she is good for another 100,000.",1
"This has been a rugged and reliable vehicle through many a New England winters now. Once over 100,000 miles you really do need to make sure to replace the timing belt and the probably the valve gaskets. If you are a diy'er it's easy enough. Most of the work actually on this vehicle is easy but it has some design quirks. Rotors are behind the hubs so brake jobs take longer, the #6 plug requires patience, extensions and swivels, DO NOT run too much oil in or your rear main seal will leak forever after. Keep it maintained like any vehicle and it's amazing. Don't expect good gas milage though.",1
"Absolutely love my Rubicon, would be a five star if the engine was a little stronger.  Never been stuck!",1
Love everything about this car except the following: Its sluggish in 1st and 2nd gear. I also have issues with the B&O sound system as there is noticeable rattle in each door and sub woofer.,1
"This is my second Sequoia, on both, the rear hatch handle and mechanism failed multiple times, seems like an engineering issue. The mileage is in the teens, but the great 4 wheel drive and body on frame HD build produce a tough SUV that has had few issues. My 2007 now has 160K and going strong! I wish the resale was closer to the truck version (Tundra) of this model.",1
"Still running pretty well with over 150k miles. Got it used and the only major repair it's needed is new rear brakes, although I will be getting new tires soon per the mechanic's recommendation",1

great truck except for bad shifting 6 speed tranny gm needs to fix this problem. Very sloppy doesn't seem to known when to shift. clones on shifts.,1
It is a good car on mileage.,1
An ok car. It still runs great and everything works even though it is an older car. I have not had any major problems with this car yet.,1
Reliable. Well built. Easy to find parts for. Always feel safe when driving. Can get expensive when time for a tune-up. Overall it's a quality American vehicle.,1
Its good,1
"Excellent car,. Good fuel mileage  Very well built and designed. Very maintenance free. Firm ride but a little noisey Engine is 5 cylinder, turbocharged. This same vehicle model is used as taxicab extensively in Europe as it is reliable and less maintenance. I recommend this car just  look for a clean one with low mileage and it will pay you dividends.",1
"It rides very nicely. Great torque from the tranny and the massive output power from the 5.7L Hemi inside!

I got into a fender bender from behind, and all the damage it had was scratched paint and the other car's paint under the spare tire. The other car was totalled! Smashed the engine block with my trailer hitch receiver! This great piece of American engineering is a tank, and I love my tank.

Speaking of tanks, this one has a smaller 16 gallon tank and could only sustain a 4 hour ride before refueling. Gets 21 mpg highway on a good day. That's the only downfall.

Overall, excellent vehicle!",1
"This vehicle is definitely a boat, but it cruises so gently and quietly. I got this car last year and it fits my family of six. The only downside is the ball joints tend to pop out of place.",1
"meets most needs, maintenance cost is low good in snow. two complaints, Driverside automatic door lock mechanism has been replaced twice, and at 107K had to replace front Passenger side hub assembly.",1
"Love this car, its fast as Hell! Pricey maintenance though, if you don't know how to do it yourself.",1
"Fully agree. Great car, but not without faults. The connector plate in the 722.9 transmission is troublesome. I had to have it replaced because a $10.00 hall-effect position sensor failed, and Mercedes won't service the plate, they insist on replacing it. Very expensive to say the least.",1

"First Ford product owned in a long time. What can I say ""Love the classical styling back to the retro heyday of the original series Mustang"". It's been a very reliable car and decent power for a V6. The downside and continues are the seats. Ford just can't seem to make a seat that is comfortable with good back support. I ordered a seat pad wedge that made a 100% improvement in long distance driving. On a nice day with the top down, wind in your hair, Eagles CD going, can't think of a better car to drive than my Mustang.",1
Love and hate relationship,1
I bought this jetta used and it has been a true surprise I have had little problems but over all the jetta is a good car fun to drive good gas mileage try 23 miles per gallon if I was to buy again I will but this next time I want new I am happy with this car,1
awesome truck..i had the crew cab..,1
Reliable car. Drives a bit differently than I would like.,1
Its a good truck. Mine has about 150k miles and has been reliable. I've had to put in some maintenance work but nothing major so far *crosses fingers*. It tows well and the off road capabilities are good.,1
"My son loves this car and plans to drive it until it no longer runs.  It has 190,000 miles on it.  Have had some mechanical issues as had to just put a new air conditioner in it and it has a manifold oil leak we need to get fixed. However, it runs great and drives nice.",1
"Love my van only down side is how fast it goes through tires. According to the shop it's common in these vans. Other than when it comes to replacing tires it's a great van. Love the big screen for the radio, electric driver seats, dual control a/c and all the room we have.",1
The only negatives would be expensive maintenance and could benefit from improved reliability. As far as driving dynamics are concerned it is excellent.,1
"Had problems with side doors when I first bought this vehicle, but after I took it to a chevrolet dealer to get it fixed, it has been working fairly decent
Is a good vehicle just keep in mind the wear and tear as any other vehicle. Fairly decent vehicle after all.",1
The car is comfortable and drives well...Gas mileage is good when on the highway...My mistake was buying the fancy red color...It scratches so easily...,1
I have owned this vehicle since 2011 and have only had normal maintenance. Love my suburban and will always have one.,1
It's been very reliable.  Steering is too light.  Gas mileage not great.  Added bushwacker fender flares and brush guards.  Makes the suv look a little tougher and more useful.,1
"I own a 2001 vw beetle with the 2.0l inline 4 and a 5 speed manual transmission...this combination may not be the fastest, but it's by far the more reliable of the beetle set ups....the 1.8 turbo has engine problems and the automatics have transmission problems...that being said these cars are fairly bullet proof...a lot of the engine parts that are usually metal are replaced with high strength plastic....yes it deteriorates BUT parts are cheap and relatively easy to replace. Idk what else to say , the only negative is that the interior hardware seemsssss..slightly cheap....most of the interior is covered in this weird wax to make it look shiny ....but it's easy to scratch impossible to really fix...and makes the entire car
Smell like
CRAYONS! Haha buuutttt I'm babbling...great dependable easy to fix cars with great gas mileage and curb appeal....well not everyone likes beetles...but cool people do! Haha",1
"I bought it used. It's been really surprising and how good it is on gas. I wasn't use to having roll up windows, but I'm getting over it slowly. Also, there is a lot of cabin noise. Once I do a little restoration on it I can bet it'll last me quite some time.",1
"Too slow...very dependable just gave to watch front and back seals when over 80,000 miles.",1
"I still have this ranger after 15 years and 140,000 miles.  It has had the routine small maintenance things pop up and some defects that have been fixed.  My dome cover popped off, broke off, and I haven't been able to fix it, the ABS system is now not working because of rust buildup I think, and the 4 wheel drive motor is not working for 4 wheel low, very rusty, Although it sounds like a lot the only thing I might want to fix now is the 4 wheel shifter motor.  Otherwise the vehicle has really been great.  There is very little body rust which is amazing.  The side door steps, bars that ran along the side below the doors, rusted very badly so I removed them.  They didn't do much really except make it look a little nicer.  I recently replaced the brake lines since one sprung a leak on my way out to Idaho from Wisconsin.  All in all like I said it has been a solid small pickup.  I have hauled a variety of heavy loads and pulled a lot of heavy loads with it and it has done well, a perfect sized truck for me.  The model I have is the club cab model, black, with the 6 cylinder engine.",1
Love the car. Wish the seats were more comfortable for larger men. With a TDI I get 42 mpg avg.  great compact car.,1
One of the best vehicles.,1
"I should've bought a new one, and will",1
Easy on Gas,1
Working good,1
"Has been a great car so far, approx. 15 mpg around town, and 23 on the Highway @ 70-75 mph
Wish the brake and throttle pedals were a little farther apart.",1
Super fun vehicle for outdoor enthusiasts. Soft top will leak and ride is pretty rough.,1
Like the car overall. Power steering doesn't offer enough assist.,1
"Mini Cooper S N14s are notorious for maintenance issues but when it's not in the shop, I love it. Quick, handles well, and has a surprisingly large amount of cargo space when the rear seats are down.",1
No leather seat and garage door open function for xle model.,1
"You buy it because it can go anywhere not for fit or finish. Rough ride, dents easy, leaks a bit, U connect is not great, fun to drive, looks great, expensive aftermarket parts, a ton of aftermarket parts.",1
"Bought mine Jan 2018, as a spare vehicle and beach vehicle. So far I've only spent about $800 just major tune up stuff 157,000miles on it and runs and drives great !!!! Always been a Ford man and was thinking of a Tahoe when this one popped up.  I sure am glad it did",1
Good truck,1
"Fun to drive..has some brake issue's, the 6sp transmission tend to slip out of gear in down gears. From what I've read it's a common issue. Abs issue's. 2008 for whatever reason has the most issue's listed. However I don't care . We love our jeep",1
"Very pleased. Comfortable, the convience package a real bang for your buck.totaly awesome mid size...",1
Great Gas Mileage. Nice ride.,1
"My wife and i purchased our 2015 Patriot from the dealer with 17 miles on it. Today it has over 27k in just over one year of ownership. This little jeep is pretty basic but very functional. She has made many road trips from SE GA up to SW MI hauling 2 kids 2 dogs and a hamster including all of their luggage. She claims everybody is comfortable and happy. Mind you the biggest perk here is the added roof rack storage using a all weather cargo unit to the roof rack. No issues whatsoever with this vehicle its only been to the shop for oil changes and tire rotations. i am confident this car will easily see over 100k miles without any major issues. Highly recommend this vehicle to small families or couples that just want a simple SUV.
I do wish i would have gotten the 4wd version though only having the 2wd leaves me wishing i could do more with it i mean it is a Jeep and i don't believe any Jeep should be less then 4wd, but that is one mans beliefs.
 I will also note my model is the Patriot Sport with the 2.4 4cyl and Automatic (non-cvt) transmission, i have heard the CVT were not very reliable. We average about 24mpg in this and thats with occasional spirited driving. Our 2 years olds car seat fits comfortably behind the passenger seat and leave enough room that i can ride in the passenger seat comfortably. I am 6`0"" 220 lbs so yea if i can fit most people can.",1
165000 miles with no major problems. A great ride on trips. Room to carry 10' 2x4's . Now showing age with rust and an annoying vacuum leak but still running strong and pulling my 22' pontoon boat.,1
"It is a great, hard running, dependable car and it came from the factory capable us using 10% ethanol gas.
The only issue i've had is the 3L DOHC model is very costly on labor the few times it's needed a repair I can't do because the engine is so big there isn't any room to easily work on it.  For example, the alternator.  They wear out and they need to be changed every 70,000 miles or so.. On the big engine it's $1000.  On the little engine, labor is maybe $100.  Power Steering pump is the same.  But this car is great.  I fold down the back seats and load in almost anything I need at Home Depot.
The models with 4-wheel disk brakes and a smaller engine could last someone a long time and be a low-cost vehicle for parts and labor.",1
Great produc fest service,1
"We bought this vehicle in 2013.  Got it for a very good price with surprising few (123K) miles considering it's age.  4WD works great.  Surprised at the quality and condition of our vehicle.  Bose sound system lives well up to it's name.
The 5.3L engine needed only minimal maintainence for it's age/miles (new plugs+wires, belts, etc.).  Did have to replace both front bearings and all brakes + 2 rotors.  Changed oil every 3K miles (recommend Castrol or Valvoline 5-30W).  With 45# in tires, our Sub got remarkable mileage on a 600 mile round trip averaging from 17 - 20 mpg.",1
The biggest issue with this or any diesel is the government/epa systems. As of now I have 400k and the only large issue was the egr,1
"I love this truck overall but it could be a lot better for the price.  The transmission (6 speed automatic) is continually shifting up and down, very annoying,the brakes could be a lot better than average, but they are not.  6000 miles so far.  18.1 mpg overall.
If you are of short statue you cannot see thru the rear window good with the headrest installed.  I have remove all of mine since no one ever rides in the rear seats.  Just my wife and I at home.
Overall this the the best tacoma I have owned but am looking forward to the 2017.
Bob R.",1
I am the original owner of this car. It has been a very reliable car. The only issue is the exhaust system has to be replaced every three years. After 17 years the car still runs well. The under carriage and suspension is about done so it will be heading to the recycle yard to be made into something different.,1
"I love my Honda pilot,  usually when you buy another vehicle you end up buying something different, that means you weren't happy with the model you had for some reason.  Well, my next car will be a pilot again.",1
"I have almost 294,000 miles on the car and it still runs great. I had to have the transmission rebuilt at 165,000 miles. It does not leak oil from the engine or transmission. The leather seats are holding up and aging great.  I recently replaced the radiator, muffler and tail pipe. I have one that was manufactured when Delmer Benz ran the company and manufactured a quality product. I have heard that after they left Chrysler, the PT Cruiser are not as good.",1
"Being 6'-6"" tall I have trouble fitting into many convertibles but not this one.  A decent car for a decent price.  The extra 400+ pounds of reinforcement to body for convertible strength really shows in regards to acceleration though.  I get 24-26 mpg [calculated] regularly.",1
Love the hardtop convertible.  Maintenance is higher than I am acustommed to.,1
Extreme offroads,1
"I recently moved to a bigger city and a large truck was no longer practical, but I didn't want to give up the utility. After doing some research a V6 RAV4 seemed my best option. I wound up settling for the base model since I couldn't find a limited in V6.

I am not in love with the bland interior it has everything I need, and some extras. The reasons I bought it: It gets decent mileage (20-25), it is easy to parallel park, 270hp and can tow my motorcycle trailer easily, 4WD for winter, and I can fit adults in the back seat. Plus Toyotas are known for reliability.

So if you feel you need 4wd and the ability to tow more than 1500lbs in compact functional package the V6 RAV4 might be a good fit for you.",1
"Once we got the bugs out we are at 117,000 miles and still running smooth.  Bugs being the cam phasers mostly. Replaced about 45,000 miles ago. Also some work on the 4 wheel drive front wheel mechanism.  I suspect previous owner ignored everything until warranty expired and left me holding the bag. I bought it used at 72,000 miles and six years ago.",1
"The powertrain is rock-solid after 45,000 miles and the truck is very comfortable.  The electrics have been an issue.  I had to replace the steering rack due to an electrical gremlin (covered under warranty).  The blower motor resistor and steering wheel-mounted audio control switches have gone as well after 4.5 years (out of warranty).  I don't really use the SYNC system, but I know some guys whom can't live without it.",1
Excellent vehicle,1
"Comfortable car for family

The use of  gas is too much ",1
"254k miles, base model with manual transmission in Southern California.

The car is pretty reliable.  The bad part is maintenance--nothing is easy.
Need to change the plugs and wires, have to remove the intake manifold.
Need to change the timing belt, have to lift the engine up and down to access some bolts.  And barely enough room to do anything.
Need to change out the heater core, have to remove your entire dash board.
Need to change the  fuel pump/fuel filter, its in the fuel tank which has to be removed.

The big issue that I see now--after 12 years and 254,000 miles, is electrical.
The heat inside the engine bay is killing the electrical components.
Batteries tend not to last 3 years.  The high temperatures causes the gases in the battery to expel and corrode the battery terminals.  Eventually the batteries will suddenly stop holding a charge (most likely a plate cracked).
Protective conduit for the wires are dried out and falling off.  If left unprotected, the wire sheathing will also start breaking off--especially if it rubs against anything--causing electrical shorts.
PCM tends to act up more in city driving.  Dashboard gauges going haywire.  Car actually dies or goes into limp mode.  But, can usually be restarted.  (If you own a PS3 or modern laptop, you know that age and heat buildup will pretty much slow or crash your system).  I've considered getting a new hood which have hood vents or hood scoops that can get cooler air in the engine bay, but its so douchey to make your PT cruiser look like a sports car.
Turbo models have more electrical problems.

I honestly expect this car to get to 350k.",1
"We bought ours new and have had very small issues over the years.  Toyota makes a great engine and transmission but the interior is relatively cheap and not built well. Even the limited looks cheap inside imo but other companies like Ford also look cheap to me. GMC excels in this area. Only get the V6 engine because the 4 is not a smart move for a midsize SUV.

Problems: Both our visors broke which is a common problem and very annoying until replaced.  Buy them online because dealers charge 2-3 times more and it's an easy swap with a Youtube video that's out.  The driver's side door panel and window also broke.  We have over 140,000 miles on it and it's going strong at 7 years old.  Just have to be willing to deal with the small stuff that comes with Toyotas.",1
"I love my 2004 Dakota. I have over 160,000 miles on it and she runs like a top. It's not perfect, age is catching up to her. I just change the normal wear items as they come up. I just put new shocks and tires on it. Next I want to replace the brakes. The cool thing is it's so easy to work on. Unlike these new electronic everything vehicles. She's also great in the snow!",1
Second suburban I have owned. Last one had 300k miles when I sold it and it still ran great (5.3 motor). This one has the 6.0 gas motor and it runs great also. Only reason it gets four stars is the gas mileage. It definitely ain't no Prius.,1
"This being my first car, I personally love it!! It's a mid-sized car with plenty or room inside and the trunk space is great. I don't have any problems with this car at all.",1
"This has been an excellent buy.  Handling is surprisingly nimble, good acceleration, and well appointed (Titanium).  Seems dependable but it is only two years old.  Like the car a lot.

Gripes: Small fuel tank, huge A-pillars, and the nanny electronics.",1
I've had my truck for 6 years or more and it's been old faithful until recently. A common problem with these trucks are having his litter issues with the hybrid motor the 5.3 L I had to go through replace litters twice. Other than that I love it,1
"Have an EX-L Coupe, V6 with 6 spd manual. Long time Honda fan. This car is soooo close to being a 5 star. The Honda-goodness is baked in. The transmission is too good to be in this car. The V6 is very smooth, has a perfect amount of power, and it has a nice throaty sound and sounds so good when the power comes on (even better when VTEC comes on). Look, quality materials, fit, finish, technology...it's so good that it feels like an Acura minus the 10k extra price.

The only issue I have are several rattles. At 13k miles they shouldn't be there. They are minor but they are there and do add up. I've had 2 corrected so far by the dealer and the other 5 they cannot duplicate when I drop the car off. Rattles are behind the glove box compartment, behind the panel where the ECON button is near drivers knee, the sun roof glass, the passenger side window rattles when the window is down, and the driver's side sun visor.

All I can live with but if they weren't there the car would be a 5. I only wonder what other rattles will pop up at 100k miles. Being that it's a Honda I'm pretty sure I'll know first hand.",1
"This was one of the finest vehicles Pontiac ever made. I've been driving mine every day for a decade now, and it is tough as nails. I've used it for everything from solo highway commuting and 12+ hour road trips 3-4 times a year to hauling timber. The fold down seats allow me to get a 10ft ladder inside the car. It is one of the most comfortable cars I have ever driven too, I am 6'4 and can stretch out and don't hit my head. I have the supercharged 3.8L V6 which has been a good strong motor and has clocked over 250k miles at this point. Just keep the oil fresh as they do burn a little and will throw a rod if you don't keep it clean. It has average mileage for a car of this era, but with a super charger that is not half bad (approx 17 City, 25 Highway) and the extra kick in the pants from the blower when you mash the petal is nice. My old girl will still smoke the tires if you let her.  Some of the semi-regular maintenance items are the brakes and hub bearings. I'm on my 6th set of brakes/calipers and 3rd set of hubs. Fortunately these parts are cheap and fairly easy to do at home in the driveway. At this point in the cars life everything rattles in the dash and the fit an finish of the interior was always a little lacking but for this era of GM, you have to just accept it. I would recommend one.",1
Nice car.,1
"Very reliable engine. Have replaced fuel pump, water pump, and starter twice. Have purchased another GMC after trying the Ford similar model.",1
Love this car. Owned lots of SUVS and this one is by far the most luxurious.,1
"Interior is typical Jeep, making the right-sizing from/to a Grand Cherokee or Dodge Durango easy. Electronics need work, several recalls and upgrades. Music system can't decide what play ifSD chip, iPhone is plugged in but you want to listen to the radio. Jumps back and forth at random. 9 speed transmission is smooth as silk.",1
Love this car.  Fun to drive.  Great horsepower.  With a car this age you have to be prepared for some repairs.  Mercedes is a little bit more to repaie then you ford or chevy.,1
I love my matrix. They do not make the 6 spd manual any more so she kind of special. She s gotten me thru snow storms int the Salt Lake City and DC area multiple times. I can fit lots of stuff in her too since she's a hatchback with back fold flat seats. Wish the gas mileage was a bit better. But she keeps me safe and is fun to drive!,1
"Truck has been low maintenance and very reliable and still is. Mine is a 4x4 which makes it more  valuable to ME. The only disappointment is the paint peeling and fading. This is a factory flaw that Dodge will not honor.
In short, if you are good to this truck it will be good to you.",1
Good safe reliable car,1
2nd one,1
Bought it with 180k so it has some pretty big issues. Lot of motors available as the 2.0 is in lot of ford cars. The tranny is a 4 speed and is being rebuilt. New set of front brakes and ball joints.,1
"bought it as a used car, so there were some problems, as it is an older car, but for the most part it is a good little car.",1
"Dependable SUV, average gas mileage with the V6, 20 to 23 on the highway, The entire voice recognition thing is very frustrating, you get tired repeating yourself louder each time. A bit rough riding and somewhat louder than you would expect from the Limited model. Interior is nice with leather seating, LED lighting and fold down rear seats that allow enough room to move a chest of drawers. The piano  black consul is a nice touch but hard to clean without streaking. The sound system is average, even with all the speakers. I find this vehicle uncomfortable to ride in on long trips, say over 4 hrs. frequent stops may be required. Mechanically though, with 65,000+ miles: tires are original, the brakes have been changed once, only one trip to the garage for a recall part, so its sound in that area. The AWD drive train is excellent in snow, never had it stuck when I lived it Ohio. All in all if you can put up with a few things this is a solid, dependable, low maint. vehicle to own.",1
Very pleased with this truck. I heard a lot of negative comments about the 6.0L diesel but I have had no issues as of yet. It's a very strong engine. My only complaint would be the gas mileage.,1
Decent vehicle - absolutely love the stow and go seating.,1
Dependable,1
Good car wish handle better in corners,1
"The good: An amazing handling car; great steering (has 4 wheel steering), acceleration and amazing braking. Mine is the Advanced model...and I will never buy a car without these features: low speed follow cruise control...you don't use the brake or gas...ever; it is a great back-up for the driver. It also steers and keeps you in your lane. Lots of interior room; The bad: The hard drive music system has to ""warm up"" for at least a minute before you can do a Music search or edit; I've had problems with the voice recognition playing songs...when it works, you just say ""Play Purple Rain"" and it does. I've had 2 minor problems that were fixed under warranty.

As a comparison, my 2009 TL was literally a ""perfect"" car...drove it over 100,000 miles with NO problems at all.",1
"Great Van!!  I would have given it 5* but some small things here and there like armrest are too low, spare tire isn't as easy as lifting it out of a ""trunk"" but everything on this van does work and work well and my complaints are more relative to an individual.  This is not a sports car but it does pick up and goes if you need to.  I'm used to small 4 cylinders so getting use to the size is something to get use to but this thing is EASY to drive.  I wish the gas would be better but I'm getting just over 20mpg as I drive.

We got this... because we have kids (2) and when we go out camping or ""play"", it was just getting crowed when you want to bring boats or gear.  This is an LE but some nice add ons.",1
"Good gas miles 30 to 35 for gallon
Not expensive to fix",1
"Overall been good. At 184K miles now and trans maybe sticking a little. Never an engine issue. Drives well.

Biggest annoyance over the years has been the doors. The power slider has had trouble in winter for years and if it fully fails will pull the power mechanism. The other door sticks and freezes shut. I ripped the handle off trying to open.

The drivers door stop mechanism broke since it was held with weak spot welds. Toyota dealer wanted $2250 for a new door. I pulled all the door trim and a welder MIG welded it. Been three years and no further issues but shouldn't have been made so poorly to begin with.",1
"As a car to drive and use, well engineered throughout.  Pleasant and responsive to drive.  Brakes and handling excellent.  LOW to the ground. Excellent seats, but the back seats have little legroom if the fronts are pushed back.  Console slightly intrudes toward driver's leg for big people.  As a wagon, you get better carrying utility by far than a sedan, and excellent visibility out the back - but don't think you can pack it like a Suburban; it is NOT a big car.  5-cyl DOHC engine pulls like a small V8, gives outstanding steady-speed mileage for a car with its capabilities (26+) - but wants premium ""petrol"".

Most serious bleat:  expense of some repairs.  You want an extra key?  Maybe $400-500.  A factory catalyst?  Maybe $1700-1800 (alternatives are available, but still could be $300 or more).

For me, was an opportunistic purchase at a lower price.  Normally wouldn't go looking for one because of potential repair expense and small choice of dealers.  It is my commuter and handles well pickup of moderately bulky stuff at Lowe's or Ikea on the way home.",1
Good product worth for the price,1
has been a very good car,1
"Love the 2012 Pathfinder. I bought this specific model for towing a small travel trailer. This is the last year Nissan built the Pathfinder on a truck frame, going to a unibody construction (for a more car-like ride) in 2013. So, the ride is a bit rough for a SUV, but it makes it stiff for towing, which is what I wanted. I do wish I had a V8 when climbing hills, but the Pathfinder does a good job towing and makes a fine daily driver. MPGs are not great, but acceptable. I get around 21 mpg on the highway, around 16-17 in mixed driving. The travel trailer cuts that in half.",1
BY FAR THE BEST TRUCK I HAVE EVER HAD.  I WOULD RATE IT A FIVE BUT THE GAS MILAGE ISNT THE BEST .,1
"My wife chose this car, and she was sure right about the reliability. You buy this like you buy a toaster: you put the bread in and it just works. 135,000 miles on it and it still looks and runs like always! Only mechanical issue is a common one in this generation- the 5-speed manual has bad synchronizers and mine went out at 115,000, but the clutch was shot at the same time so the labor doubled up. I bought a rebiilt online and my mechanic put it in. Other than that, just maintenance, brakes, and one wheel bearing in all these miles. Usually 27MPG city, 35 HWY, about 30 avg.

So why only 4 stars? It's BORING. I enjoy driving, and this car simply has no edge, no driving dynamics. I've driven the equivalent Honda (Civic), Mazda (Mazda3), and VW (Golf) over the past few years and all of them put this to shame... the VW the most of the three. The suspension is mushy, the transmission imprecise, and the engine just kind of sits there. Not dangerously slow, just numb. I have a fun Summer car to enjoy or otherwise I'd have had to trade this years ago out of sheer tedium. But my budget doesn't allow the luxury just to drive to work.",1
I love my E350 4matic wagon.. She purrs like a kitten. I has a few issues to address but overall a BEAUTIFUL car.. over 175k now.,1
"I had the luxury of redoing brakes, suspension and engine. That and a positraction rearend plus electronic upgraded. It is my daily driver set up beyond police interceptor and marauder specs. I am 71 and this is my rat rod to go to Walmart.",1
"Dependable, 97,000 miles and not problems except for normal maintenance.  Poor fuel economy.  Plan on keeping it another 10 years.",1
"The car is beautiful inside out.  The hybrid drive-train took me sometime to get use to but it works for me with all the fuel savings.  I wouldn't mind the V6 version however, for the smoother engine and better power.  The biggest drawback of this car is the outdated infotainment system.  The UI designers definitely failed Toyota.  My other car is a Ford from the same year, and MyFordSync is such a pleasure to use compare to Toyota's Entune system.",1
Great car.  Fun to drive.  I really like the 7 passenger seating.,1
"So far so good.  Bought this with a lot of miles on it, but with impeccable dealer maintenance records and one owner.  Will continue to maintain MYSELF. Just finished an air filter change, cabin filter change, oil filter and full bottom drain as well as tire rotation. Essentially the A2 service. Dealer would have been $600+, but I was only out around $160 for materials.  And yes, did buy the fancy spec synthetic diesel oil. Which was $85 by itself. Recommend filters from Amazon if you can find.  Love the 34 MPG combined on this.  Amazing efficiency for weight and performance. Don't love...all the stuff that could potentially go wrong...7 spd tranny, 4-Matic, twin turbo diesel, HIGH psi injectors.",1
"The vehiclw has 180,000 miles on it and has proven to be very dependable, other than doing the normal maint and replacing the alternator, t has been problem free.",1
"I bought my 2006 Durango in 2007. It was used with about 35,000 miles on it. I have seen other Durangos that have rusted badly. Mine is showing quite a bit of rust. Bottom of front fenders, bottom of drivers side rear door(badly), rocker panel under drivers door, rear hatch. I have only had one issue with the engine. The RPM would cycle from 1,000 to 1,500 RPM at idle. I took it to the local Dodge Dealer and they said they fixed it. They did not. As soon as I drove into my garage and put it in park it started to cycle. Thanks to YouTube I was able to find the problem. It was a $35 throttle body sensor that I replaced myself. I just recently replaced the rear shocks at 135,000 miles. They were shot. What a difference in the ride. I still need to replace the font shocks. Overall, I have been pleased with my 12 year old Durango. I tow a 16ft. aluminum boat and a pop-up camper and have plenty of power with the 4.7 Liter V-8 engine. The front spoiler(skirt) that is mounted to the bottom of the front bumper broke when I hit a small snow drift. I have not replaced it yet. I really do like driving the Durango and even with the rust that is showing I will most likely be driving it for a while. I just need to stop the rust from spreading.",1
"Have a 4 matic that handles great in snow, all weather..My fifth Mercedes and the smallest...a little low to get in and out of, but other than that, a great zippy car,  as all of my prior Mercedes, it handles great.",1
"Probably not the most practical daily commuter, but I love this Jeep.  It's fun and I have no trouble finding parts for modifying it from stock.  It's a really fun vehicle.  Just remember, this is a 4WD vehicle, not a Lexus Sports coupe or a family SUV.  It's a little noisy.  It's a little clunky.  It's simple, no frills transportation, because when you want to go off road, you don't want to worry about your precious accessories.  It's rugged and simple.  If you wanted comfort or hands free internet, then buy the Lexus.",1
"Good basic daily driver.  So far have 170,000 miles on it and should be good for at least another 100,000.  Has had quite a bit of service over the years.  Tires in particular do not last very long and have replaced the front shock absorbers more often than other cars I have had. Rust will be the main problem - doors have a rubber strip at the bottom (partly removed on my car) which holds water.  Most of the cars I see have rust at the lower door area and also in the running board area.",1
"Great car.  Parts are cheap and plentiful.  Not a performance car but will last a long time if maintained even minimally.

Lost 1 star because of lack of corrosion mitigation in general.

All Japanese cars prior to 2006 seem to corrode easily.",1
It's a nice truck with decent gas mileage. Any initial problems I had were worked out. Not a big fan of chevylinki though. It van be slower than what I had with sync.,1
"The Ford Edge Sport is a fantastic car in all respects except two.  First, the Ford Sync system is a mess.  Its a great concept and when its working properly, its awesome.  But there are just way too many bugs.  For example, about 25% of the time I start my car, an old voicemail starts to play through the bluetooth connection.  Random.  Sometimes, if I get a call, whatever I was playing through bluetooth will stop so I can take the call.  Other times, it just keeps playing right through the call.  When it stops, sometimes it will not restart, even manually, after the call is finished.  Random again.  And voice recognition for making phone calls?  Forget it.  Absolutely useless.  Second, the front seats just aren't that comfortable.  The sides of the seat come up too high, so they pinch into the side of my legs, and there could be an inch or two more legroom.  I'm kind of big at 6'1"", 210 lbs.  But not so big that I would expect these comfort issues.  Were it not for these two issues, I would be giving the car five stars, because in all other respects, its awesome.  The power, handling and cargo room are unbelievable for an SUV this size.",1
"Good truck, prob with turbos, check engine light keeps coming on, and only 38,000 miles",1
"2014 charger rt hemi automatic transmission , I absolutely love this car ,,,,,except for the glare from the dash on the windshield , that is annoying and it now at around 25k miles it has shifting issue , sometimes not very often  it will do a over rev slam from 3-4 but other than that I am glad I bought it ..........  I love this car !",1
S***y gas money,1
Awesome car to drive,1
I have two of them.  Good as a jeep but much cheaper.  I think the 1.6 liter motor is a better motor than the 2.0 liter however.,1
"Excellent truck ! Very little Road noise lots of power and very comfortable
To drive. Best hightway mpg iv gotten was 25.5 on the highway. Average highway is around 22 mpg and city driving is around 18 mpg. Only thing I don't like are the headlights. The beam is narrow and doesn't throw far enough ahead. I upgraded to HID lights and made a world of a difference.",1
I like my 2016 chevy silverado 1500.,1
"I like the overal truck, handling, looks and HP are good.  A V8 option would be nice.  A little more room in the driver seat area would be nice.",1
Really like this pickup. I picked the 5.0 engine as I have had 2 ecoboosts and the 5.0 out performs and gets better fuel mileage.,1
Very nice and quiet interior.  Bright and stylish headlights.  Only issue so far is the transmission doesn't know what gear to go in at low speeds.  Like other people say it's clunky.,1
"Really nice good looking truck to drive.  Gets good gas mileage for the size of vehicle.  I wish I could turn off the horn alarm so I don't accidently set it off.  Also, it would be nice to have a tighter bed like the 2013 and earlier models.  I purchased a bed cover, but had to seal  all of the holes in the bed seams to keep the dust out.  Still haven't figured out how to completely seal the rear tailgate.  But, over all I am enjoying the truck.  I just hope it will hold up well.  Only time will tell.",1
The parts that I have ordered have all been the correct ones but you do need to be careful and read the discription to make sure it will fit as you are taking a risk as always buying online for car parts but over all very happy and great prices,1
"I have a black avalanche with gray cladding. Looks pretty cool , I'm a tech at a shop and know the 5.3 V8 and the 4L60 set up is in a lot of GM trucks. This combo I have seen go to 300000 miles easy with GOOD MAINTENANCE. Like the way you can fold down the back glass so you have a normal length bed. Also like the side storage compartments, for chains,pull straps,loading straps, and so forth.",1
"In general our 2012 Enclave has been great.  It's extremely quiet with a comfortable ride and plenty of storage room for long trips.  It would earn five stars were it not for General Motors overall build and reliability issues.  In 50,000 miles we have already replaced the air conditioner and the water pump under warranty.  The power steering pump sounds like it will be next but hasn't yet failed.  It just whines like a Ford every few days and has for more than a year despite repeated inspections to find an issue.  We would definitely buy another Enclave but not sure we would keep it much beyond warranty period.",1
"My car is a '98 M3 convertible with 100k. I am now cycling through the replacement of wear items. The parts are not terribly expensive and I have a certified non-dealer technician I am very happy with it. The car is a blast, fast enough with great handling. Repairs are: front end rebuild; shocks, control arms and stabilizer links, New cats, fuel pump, air mass meter cleaning, convertible top elastics and alignment, tires, tune up and oil maintenance.  I will need a new clutch in the next several thousand miles as it is engaging near the floor and I purchased a new high performance radiator, water pump assembly as these historically been failure items.  Over all great value, looks good, drives great. Very high value for the current used car prices. Have you prospective car inspected prior to purchase.",1
"<div id=""video-block-R3UZN56UHY3GTR"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91pE126e%2BkS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IjAe9dWGS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;As someone who's first car was a used 2001 f150 XLT 4.2 V6 i can say that i am totally happy with the money i have invested in the truck and the entire truck itself.

i got the truck when i was 15 and it had 103k on it, i am now 21 and it has 154k on it. it has moved me out, taken me across the state and back and on multiple long drives in the state. you do the math, it has a lot of miles on it.

-At 120k i had all the spark plugs replaced and the ignition coil replaced because it was running rough (ran rough when we bought it) it was like a brand new truck.

-At 125K the fuel pump went out and i replaced the fuel pump and fuel filter in my drive way with some help from family, the fuel efficacy was a drastic change when i replaced this. (barely got 9 mpg before fuel pump change)

-At 150K the factory 4.2 v6 engine dropped a valve and threw a rod on the highway going 70 MPH, scariest sound ever but i was headed to the shop to have it worked on at the time knowing that it was about to throw a rod. mind you, this engine had a oil leak from the first owner, and made it 150k and had sat not being used in a garage for 5 years before the previous owner sold it to the dealership where i bought it. paid just about 3k to have a Sport 4.2 put into the truck.

i have done custom work on mine, custom stacked exhaust, aftermarket radio, cold air intake and a tuner. it has taken all these upgrades with no issues. i foresee the truck lasting up to 200k and perhaps beyond if i still own it by then.

overall, as my first truck it has plenty of power, bed space and cab space (standard cab) for myself and 2 friends. i can easily load everything i need from grocery shopping in this truck with no issues and besides some basic repairs needed on a older high mileage vehicle i am happy that this got to be my first vehicle. i do recommend any 2001 f150 if you are looking to buy, don't be fooled by online forums. the 4.2 v6 is no slouch,  not a race engine by any means but it is also not a weak engine for towing either. a very good in-between

below video is my truck, just a fun vid of what this truck could be with some work!",1
"Great Car!  I purchased mine in 2001 (2000 model) and I still drive it daily.  I have had minimal problems with this vehicle, and just routine maintenance.",1
"Comfortable, good ride, good mileage.  Lowe would be better with the V6, but for my use the 4cl is very acceptable.",1
Overall a great truck.  ABS went out right after warranty expired.  Issue with electric in Driver side window.  No other issues for the 11+ years I've owned it.  Starting to see some rust around the windows.,1
"This car still looks great, but you better know how to work on cars and have a lot of patience.",1
Reliable car up to 100.000 miles. Had ecm problem. After 10 years no part available. Other then rust spot on rear quarter panel been a good vehicle. Plan on keeping for a while longer. Hopefully till 150.000 miles.,1
"This car is incredible. Original owner. I lived through the madness of the 22 recalls the first year. I buckled in and hang tight. Glad I did. Car was totaled by an out of control WRX punk 6 years ago and I sunk the insurance money right into a body shop to bring her back to life. Everything has been replaced on her like twice, bht that Zetec engine is money. Still getting 35mpg at 190k miles with basic maintenance. I know 300k is unlikely, but it's a goal. Love this car. Stereo rocks. Handling is go kart like. My first new car and likely my last. When she kicks the bucket I hope to get into 7 or 8 year old Focus RS AWD. What can I say? I'm a snow hound. She'll be missed regardless.",1
I think it is a good buy for the money.  I can also see where they saved money on the manufacturing of this vehicle.,1
"This was a good car.  I got it new and put 212k miles on it in 12 years with relatively few mechanical problems.  The 6 cylinder had some get up and go.  I did seem to have some issues with the cooling system.  Spark plugs are tough to replace because of engine placement and its a big job just to replace the thermostat.  In fact I did much of the mechanical work myself including brakes, water pump.",1
The parts was very well worth the money,1
"So far I've had my since nov 2016. It is the black 1941 anniversary edition. This is my first jeep but so far she has been great to us. We have taken it to Texas and Oklahoma multiple times and already had to change the oil in it twice from traveling so much. My only issue is sometimes the feature that turns the car off to save fuel, this will happen randomly when I am stopped. It doesn't initially turn it off if I am stopped for more than 5-10 seconds. But right as I'm about to go it will stop and immediately turn on. It's doesn't always do that, it just sometimes does. Otherwise I love my jeep and won't be getting rid of it for a very long time.

Also, I went from a 2013 Honda Accord to a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee, If that helps.",1
"great look, nice interior, handles well except it has no pick up. I have the 4 cylinder and it is slow on the 0-60",1
"We have owned this car for many years. From 140k to now 210k. Issues to watch out for: timing belt, idler pulley,  transfer case replacement. Change oil using 0-40. Syn. Great power and impressive MPG. I do a lot of the work so for me this car a keeper. Use Blue radiator fluid",1
"I love the car overall. Great styling, smooth ride, peppy performance and very nice driver assist features. I have had some  quirky problems with the  electrical system. The car wouldn't recognize the key fob so wouldn't start without putting the key into the ignition or unlock the door when I approached. Took 4 trips to resolve. Seat adjustment switch for the drivers seat was defective. The car tried to surge forward on several occasions while at a stop. A couple of times it was quite strong and could have resulted in crunching the car in front of me if I didn't have my foot firmly on the brake. That problem seems to have resolved itself.",1
"Love it has plenty of room, handles great
and get around 19+ mpg in town and
around 24+ on road.",1
"I have a Mazda 3 HB and love the car! It's convenient, runs well, and does what I need it to do. However, it is a bit noisy at higher speeds as the cabin isn't as quiet as I would like. I have had some issues with the manual shifter sometimes but it seems as though it's a problem related to cold temperatures and thicker stock transmission fluid. Otherwise, it's fun to drive and gets decent gas mileage so not complaining here.",1
"2012 was the last year for the V6,very peppy, it runs on regular(unlike most SUV's in it's size, which have turbos , requiring premium gas) The 2012 Rav 4  still has the spare on the tailgate ,which would be a potential problem in hilly cities like San Francisco, or Seattle because the tailgate swings to the side and the spare tire makes the tailgate very heavy. However since the spare is external there is a nice sized storage compartment where the spare would normally go.
 The RAV 4 handles well, I assume costlier European models handle much better?",1
Maintenance is key to preserving this vehicle and I love it,1
"Though I purchased this vehicle with 140,000 mls. on it, I had very few problems with it. Of course with the exception of the small few I had to fix, which I accomplished on my own with the help of a mechanic. Right now she's running better or just as good as a lot of the later model jeeps out there.",1
"When this car runs perfectly, it's an easy 5 stars. Unfortunately, there's always something wrong with it. Granted, I bought it used and the previous owner neglected all regular maintenance. The worst part is I have an obnoxious power steering pump squeal that won't go away. I've tried changing pretty much anything related to it. Now it seems like I'm being really negative for a 4 star here. However, all the problems are minor and have never actually stopped the car from being functional. I just simply hate when things aren't perfect.

On to the positives, this car has way more power than it needs. This makes it super fun to drive. It will run 100mph without breaking a sweat. On the downside, it's fwd so off The line is a bit slow. Its only slow because The tires spin really easily. The trunk is massive, I have 2 12"" subs in there and still plenty of room for groceries or whatever. It rides as smooth as any other car I've been in and doesn't generate much road noise. It is spacious on the inside and generally easy to modify. I've changed the head unit, headlights, added subs, and a backup camera. All of which went smoothly and was easy to accomplish.",1
"I love my Frontier.  Just hit 200k and never had a problem.  Has been across the country 3 times, once pulling a car.  Has Tons of power.  I also like the bed rail system with tailgate extender.  This is an add-on for Toyota.",1
good truck.  4x4 works good.  wish it were more fuel efficient though.,1
this has been an extremely reliable car and continues to be with minimal maintenance outside of the regular intervals.,1
Needs more low end torque. Lower standard gears.,1
All good except Android or Apple play.  Will be a good upgrade for this nice car.,1
"I love my chev 2500.  Pulls my boat with ease, looks fantastic, rides great and I got a fantastic deal.  When ford and dodge was not being up front on the pricing and discounts, chev quoted me a price that was in my budget up front and we did the deal with no surprises.",1
"Very good truck. Fit and finish. Plenty of towing power with 4:11 gears.
Only flaw.... 14mpg highway. It's 100% terrible on fuel mileage.",1
Very good products found for mr truck......,1
Very reliable and no problems in 84000 miles.,1
"It's a fine Van, we use it to transport our dogs an goods and I as daily driver to work. No complicated electric, most easy to repair and mostly cheap spare parts. Only some special parts are not possible to deliver, like headlamps etc.. We love it.",1
Ford motor company pulled off a classic truck while enduring the finnacial hardships of the late 80's into the new era of the early 90s. This is my 5th ranger nothing newer then 92 box style. It not only flooded the marketplace it reinvented how we go about our daily tasks with its twin I beam front suspension and push button four wheel and the options were endless. Granted they struck out with there automatic trans. But with dark comes light in the form of a couple of the best 5 speed manual trans ever bulit. Still driving my 92 xlt daily and hauling firewood weekly. Amazon makes it almost effortless to maintain my truck with quality parts and excellent selection. Lets not forget there excellent service.,1
"Mine is the Jetta SportWagen version. This is a really good car and has been 100% reliable since I bought it 2 years ago-no problems whatsoever. It has a powerful 2.5L 5-cylinder gasoline motor. Full synthetic oil is called for in the owner's manual and it takes 6+ quarts to fill.
It has the best transmission I've ever experienced, 6-speed Tiptronic transmission with 3 modes: In Drive it's geared for everyday driving and to get the best gas mileage (upper 20s around town but I've never taken it on much of a road trip).  A super nice Sport mode that is slower to upshift and faster to downshift, which keeps the RPMs higher and thus has more power when compare to Drive. The car feels very powerful in this mode. With the engine and Sport Mode transmission combination, it drives like a sports car and goes like a bat out of hell. Really! There's also a manual mode if you really like shifting your own.
The steering and suspension are superb-has a great almost sports car feel while it rides on 16 inch wheels.
Seating is comfortable for average and small people. It's probably cramped for large people. The windshield slopes back quite a bit and can be a little hard to get in and out. The rear seats fold flat and gives a cargo area that is actually greater than that of many small SUVs.
The front seats have a power back rest adjustment but a manual forward and rear adjustment. My front seats have 3-level seat heating and they heat up very quickly.
I don't like the controls for the wipers or the cruise control-too small.
The audio system includes Bluetooth.
The power windows are 1-touch both up and down on all 4 windows. Nice.
Overall, I like this car a lot.",1
good,1
Great car. Fit and finish is excellent. Comfortable seats and plenty of leg room in backseat.trunk space more than adequate. Only reason I did not give a five star. Because a little disappointed in gas mileage.,1
"It runs great and needs very little servicing but it only has 22,500 miles.",1
Love almost everything about it except that the roof leaks and there is a a hesitation that occurs randomly while driving that the Jeep people can't seem to find because it is not throwing a code. But with these few problems I still like it more then the newer ones.,1
"Overall a very comfortable and fun car to drive.  My wife is much smaller than I and the power adjustable front seats are a real plus.  Very quiet with little engine noise in the cabin.  Everyone appreciates the heat/cooling outlet in the rear seating area.  Steering is sure and responsive.  A bit of a visibility issue with the design of the rear window, but that seems to be a common complaint with most newer cars.  Starting forward from a stop, the transmission is a bit jerky moving into second gear.  I recommend the Fusion as an affordable mid-size car.  Definitely worth checking out.  I bought ours as a certified used car from a Ford dealership.  I would consider a Fusion in any future auto purchase.",1
Good little car but expensive to fix. That's normal with Audi's tough,1
"The truck has been great, I have owned the truck since new.  I have only had to do continuous maintenance on the vehicle like oil changes, brakes, belts.  Engine and transmission are solid.",1
very good car love it just that the ignition  went bad cost a pretty penny to fix I replace the whole system fuel pump solenoid  spaks plugs  now the key ignition dealer wanted 700 dollars but I found it cheap on here,1
"Love this car. Would give it 5 stars, but fit and finish is still Chevrolet. Now that it's getting rare, it gets a lot of looks. Big engine, all the power you really need. Would buy it again.",1
Loved it--till wrestling my son's car seat in the back. Great gas mileage. Excellent turning radius.,1
"It's been a good relaible car. So far I've only had to replace the battery, an intake manifold sensor, the tires at 40,000 miles, and a fuel filter. Other than the usual scheduled maintenance, that's pretty darn good since 2009. Overall it's been great on gas, and very reliable.",1
Love the truck it suits all my needs its comfortable and drives well too. I'm not a big fan of the utiitrac system though but that's mainly because there are not many accessories to allow you to use it. All you get is a set of tie down cleats. But everything else about the truck I love,1
"Very solid, well designed car inside and  out.  Mine has 170,000 miles on it (I bought it a  28,000 miles).  It has  given me very limited  problems. The inside is very elegant, well above similar priced  models  that I looked at.  I am sad to see the Saturn brand go.",1
"good van in general. has poor radio reception. Found out poor reception was caused by having phone charger plugged into 12 volt power outlet, when removed radio played fine.",1
My is the GTI model; fun to drive and good on gas too; live here in Montana my next one will probably be the VW Tiguan 4-Motion,1
"Very good for family. Mileage is the main concern. I have the car for almost 6 years and will replace with a new Enclave, if it get a little better mileage",1
really like my truck.  fuel efficiency is the weak link.,1
"I bought this car in September 2012... coming from a Mini Cooper.  Love the get up and go the car has but I have to admit it really stinks as far as gas mileage.  I drive about 50 miles or more a day.  It seems like I am forever filling the car up.  It also has a weird thing happening with the hood of the car.  I have adjusted it several times and I have also brought it into to the dealership for adjustment but it just continues.  It lifts and shakes while driving the highway.  It was really unnerving at first but then after realizing and then just being told that ""it just has to be adjusted"" again. It locks in pace, it just lifts with the wind.  Again, it bothers me but it doesn't seem that there is any sort of fix for it.  All in all it is a good car.  I feel safe and it has been reliable thus far.  It has had some quirks with the a/c system fan blowing out and locks not working but nothing that wasn't fixed by Nissan - no cost to me.  I would recommend the car as it is extremely fun to drive.  It drives like a sports car.  It moves quick when needed.  It has an adjustment for eco driving for highways (supposedly to save gas) and then when you need to punch it has a setting for the get up and go times.  All in all it has been a great little car that I hope to have for at least 5 more years.",1
"A great driving, riding automobile.  Gas mileage has been between 15/18 in town and from 23/29 on the highway, and that is with the
Northstar V8 engine!!!",1
"Just bought a used F-150 XLT Crew Cab 4x4 with 140,000 miles on her. Immediately drove 1300 miles from Florida to New York. Performed perfectly. Thanks to the above reviews, I can watch for stuff to happen.",1
"most  mpg  front view  seat comfort  tire wear 100,000miles + on 2 different sets so far

least  low beam front head bulbs have failed 6 times, 3 right 3 left  I purchase vehicle 4/16
  this is unacceptable",1
the 8.1l v8 coupled with the 5 speed Allison automatic has to be the most durable combination,1
Very pleased ...need to replace the motors that operate the door locks and side view mirrows .,1
I don't like the active fuel management. I don't see difference in fuel mileage. Turning the active fuel management off made a big difference in how the truck runs. It seems like it doesn't make a difference in fuel mileage with or without a.f.m.,1
it is a slt. I hope I don't have a lot of trouble with all the dodads,1
4 cylinder model is great!,1
"Apart from being really bad on gas, I like its power! I can get out of a lot of situation WITHOUT 4wd. The customization of space is also really good.",1
Only problem I have is its power and im hoping a performance chip will take care of that. But overall its a great SUV.,1
"I like mine it's good on gas decent power handles well. Good ground clearance.  Only thing that I'm not a fan of is with two car seats in the back seat not enough room for another child back there. I also have over 200,000 miles on mine.",1
"I picked up a used 2016 certified pre-owned from a local dealership and after test driving the 2 and 4 wheel drive versions and 2 different trims.  I ended up with a typical mileage (10k miles) used car that was clean, previously owned by a company.  Carmax and title checks were clear and no wreak or damage found.  After having the car for 6 months and putting 5k miles on it I am happy with the car.  I have the Advanced and Technology packages which are great, you must read how to use the IDS and D/S modes else the car can be unruly.  Heated and cooled seats, lane assist, emergency stopping, adaptive cruise control, all great.  I love the IDS and D/S settings which really change the way the car handles and feels.  The paddle sifters are great but the transmission can do a better job through all the gears.  The mid row seats heat and cool like the front can and the DVD system is great for long trips.  Sound system is ok and with it integrated into the overall system makes aftermarket upgrades too much trouble to deal with.  AC works fast but impacts gas mileage too much.  Averaging around 25 highway and 20 city, I found using cruise control helps keep the MPG as high as possible.  Lots of room for the family and we keep the 3rd row down for the storage space.

Pros: Great leather seats (heat and cool), front collision avoidance really works!, adaptive cruise control, IDS, rear seat wireless headphones for the DVD, 110v AC adapter in the rear, back up camera works great at night, rear cargo tie downs, multiple DC plugs up front and in 2nd row for charging/electronics, auto dimming rear view and side mirrors, USB plugs for audio drives, road noise is low, technology package allows Acura app to remote lock, start, and check on vehicle status from anywhere!  Interior HEPA filter, auto setting memory for both key fobs (seats, mirrors, steering wheel), back up alert system works great for cars in blind spots.

Cons:  Infotainment system is seriously behind the times.  GPS with real time updates is very slow and often wrong and the alternative options are not optimal.  Pairing to one phone at a time is limiting to those of us with multiple phones, Bluetooth pairing is slow and fails for some phones, Navigation system is very slow to respond to inputs and makes wacky suggestions on routes to take, it has put me on service roads and restricted access roads too many times.  No fog/haze lighting, small glove box, in-door cup holders are mostly useless, Stereo sound is low and can't be easily upgraded, small rear window wash reservoir, no Android or iPhone mirroring/linking to system touch screen.",1
"Reliable little car whose biggest asset is that every morning, it turned on. Is it the most stylish and comfortable? Nope. Is it something to make ladies swoon, and men salivate? No. Can you go from 0 to 60 in a minute? Not really. Can it climb mountains? Sure, if you give it enough time.

But what it does do, which is to turn on, it does it well. I owned the GXE Manual version of this car. I bought it at 70k miles, and the only reason why I got rid of it at 270k miles was because some idiot teenager plowed into it while it was parked on the street. The car was still functional and drove great when I sold it for $400 to a guy who drove it to Chihuahua, Mexico. It was just missing the back wheel, but besides that, still a solid ride.

It had power locks and power windows that still went up and down, a fancy little dongle thingy to unlock the car from afar, and was really sexy with it's 2000 CD player. It had a very practical number of cup holders, 2 in front and 2 in the back. The ""lumbar"" support on the driver's seat has much to be desired, but I don't think the R&D team spent a lot of time on the comfort aspect of the car. When you got in this car, you are instantly reminded this car wasn't meant to be comfortable. Instead, it was to build character and give you a constant worry about how far behind in your retirement fund you are.

In the 200k miles and 10 years that I owned the car, these are the things that died on the car:
AC Pump (that's my fault, as I knew it was leaky, but allowed the pump to run dry)
A bolt that somehow got stuck onto the gas pan thingy and had to be sawed off
Windshield wiper fluid reservoir (it fell out of the engine compartment)
The oil dipstick broke and had to be fished out
Car horn stopped working
Front cigarette lighter stopped working
Heater was dying

I feel like that's pretty good considering. I, as a very responsible car owner, did do regular oil changes with quality oil, and made sure my fluids were always topped off. But that was about it. Brakes, rotors, spark plugs, batteries, tires, etc. were also replaced, but that just falls under basic maintenance. The suspension was also shot. A few of the ball joints and control arms were definitely rusty and should have been replaced. Honestly, the whole underside of the car needed serious help, but I never did any maintenance or changed out parts so that is to be expected. The car has a chain timing belt, so I never got the timing belt done. And the car was a manual, so I didn't have to worry about an automatic transmission. Original clutch held strong the entire time, however.

The car is very simple to maintain, and you can perform all basic maintenance yourself. It is also very easy to repair yourself. It is a very straightforward and simple car, with all it's pieces in practical places. You really didn't need any fancy tools, or very bendable arms. You also don't need a lot of money to maintain and repair this car if you are DIYer. The parts for this car are actually very affordable. It was like this car was really cheap to begin with and for poor people.

Catalytic converter throws errors easily, which is a bit annoying. Basically, it looks like it throws an error for anything under 99.7% efficiency. But it always passed emissions, so I used it as an auto mechanic bullshit meter, which is useful when you are a car clueless girl and some mechanic is trying to convince you the error means your car is going to explode.

I can't comment on the safety of the car, as I was never in an accident with it or died due to it. It has very few safety features when compared with newer cars, however, that also means less sensors you have to deal with. Car don't care if you don't have brake lights, or if your airbags don't work, or if it is on fire. It will let you drive it in whatever condition it happens to be in, even if it means you will die. As with all front wheel drive cars, it does lousy in snow/rain/mildly moist conditions. However, I driven over the Rocky Mountains in a blizzard in this car before, and it surprisingly made it multiple times. Go slow and use the right gear, and this car will get you places. Eventually.

This car has driven from California to Nebraska to Colorado to Georgia to Illinois to British Columbia. It's driven up mountain passes, basked on beaches, and scuttled along on very ""rugged"" dirt roads. However, it is a decent road tripping car only due to the great gas mileage. I got 35 mpg from this car easily, though on highway I got up to 42 mpg before. Also handy, the back seats do fold down, so you can get some slightly longer items loaded into the trunk, like a hat stand. That trunk was like Mary Poppin's bag though. I was amazed at how much junk I was able to shove into it.

If you want a a very mediocre, cheap, simple to maintain car that miraculously keeps turning on, this is the car for you. If you want style, safety features, engine power, and back pain relief, you should probably look at other cars.",1
I bought the Jeep new after I retired.  I have had a few minor issues but overall I have been pleased with it. I am thinking about getting another Jeep product as my Granddaughter has her eyes on this one as she will be turning 16 this year. It would be a good car for her.,1
"We purchased this Avalon new, it had a few recalls and those were taken care of, There was a TSB on the steering column, It made a clicking noise, This was repaired when the car had around 30000 miles on it.  around 8000 miles later it started making the noise again, the dealer did not want to fix it. I wrote Toyota a letter about it and they ended up paying for it, The car now has 45000 miles on it and has been problem free.",1
"Doesn't have Car Play so the expensive tech package we bought to get auto brake is mostly worthless.  Spouse likes the car, okay for a car bases crossover.",1
Very comfortable ride it has all the bells and whistles as standard my only complaint would be the gas mileage,1
"I kept this car from 100,000 miles until 240,000 miles when it was totalled in an accident. The only complaint I'd have is the automatic transmission for the V6. I had replace it once at about 150,000 miles, and expected to have to replace it one more time if I was to keep the car past 300,000 miles. The car was comfortable, smooth, rattle-free and nearly everything worked perfectly to the end. The engine was strong and never leaked or burned oil.",1
It's Great car. Engine is sound. I change the out oil every 3000mi. Is so. The sun down here had havoc on the interior. The paint on the hood has literally baked of. In moving to NY as soon as possible,1
"I Became the owner of this truck at about 110K miles.

typical high mileage problems:  I have had to replace both inner and outer tie rods on both sides, as well as the wheel hub assembly on both sides.  The pitman arm and idler arm had to be replaced. I've had two O2 sensors go out, and  The front drivers side axe seal began leaking and had to replace.  The rubber boot was cracked on the axel which caused the axel to wear out, and so I replaced the whole front drivers side axle.  I'm waiting for the other side to go out too.

Poor design Problems:  I have a knock sensor that is bad that I have put off replacing for now (it's big job).  This is due to water be able to get to the sensor and cause corrosion and thus a poor ground.  This issue is a sensitive issue and requires some research before tackling the issue.  Correcting this also mean taking actions to fix the original design so that it won't happen again.

I'm at 140K now and all these issues really are not that big of deal, they are expected when you go over 100K  it would fall under the routine maintenance category.  Minus the knock sensor, that is a result of poor design.  If I had to pay a shop for all this work, it would have cost o lot of money, but I was able to do it myself for much cheaper, and I got to keep the tools.  I've had no trouble with the engine, transmission, or other thing that I would not be able to fix myself.  Thus, I conclude that it is a fairly decent truck, and judging by other reviews, I better get over 200K  on it.  I have no major problems with it.",1
Overall a solid truck..gas milage could be better....tune up costed over a grand because of poorly designed plug placement,1
"I purchased the 00 gs400 back in 2000. I still have this car and it has over 500,000 miles. Same engine, transmission.... I have maintained the car myself and it has been the car all my daughters ( 4 ) have learned to drive with.",1
Very ribald by all standards,1
"Typical jeep, you buy one for the off road ability and not creature comforts. It's not fast, doesn't get the best mileage, it's noisy and the a/c leaves a lot on the table. I wouldn't have it any other way. It's my ninth jeep product I've owned throughout the years. Once you get the jeep bug it's hard to stray away. Would have given it five stars but the dealership I bought it from, (San Antonio dodge Chrysler jeep), will forever be a sore spot with me. Poor service from top to bottom.",1
"Awesome truck, but the mpg makes me have second thoughts.",1
"The car is a collaboration between GM and Toyota, and it uses a Toyota drivetrain. The 5 speed manual transmission has a notoriously weak front countershaft bearing, making it very prone to early failure. Aside from that, they're extremely reliable. My Vibe interior is very well designed and comfortable for our growing family. The passenger front seat has a rigid plastic surface on the back and folds flat into a table. Many a diaper has been changed on mine!

My Vibe has 196,000 miles on it and considering the 5 speed has been rebuilt it should last to 250,000 easily.",1
very good at handling. but expensive.,1
It was the first new car I bought in 15 years .,1
Mechanically the truck has been very good.  I have only had a couple of minor repairs.  Just changed the original brake pads at 150000 miles.  There was still a couple of thousand miles left in the pads.  Body wise not so good.  I had rust thru at 7 years in the rear fenders.  Now the driver side rocker panel is starting to go.  Head liner is starting to come loose.  151000 miles the other day.  If they made the body as good as the drive train it would be an excellent truck.  It is an SLT extended cab.,1
"I've put 55,000 miles on my 2016 Touareg TDI Executive and had only one issue with the voice command system. Otherwise the vehicle has  been flawless. This is not, however, a mainstream SUV. It is a ""mid sized"" hauler that still only seats 5 but offers more room than compact SUVs. If you're predisposed to a Honda Pilot or Ford Explorer this is not your vehicle. You will find it over priced and perhaps under equipped compared to mainstream choices. It will appeal to you if you're a contrarian who doesn't like seeing yourself on the road all the time. It will appeal if you want luxury on the inside but don't want to proclaim status on the outside. It will appeal if you want an overbuilt, bank vault that feels like it's traveling in the roadway, not on it. And, it will appeal if you want thoughtful, no-compromise engineering that delivers subtle features and advantages not immediately apparent but that are discovered over time as you use the vehicle. Remember, the Touareg is the same platform as the Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 models built through 2016. All three went down the same assembly line in Slovakia. You can view the Touareg as a really expensive Volkswagen or a bargain basement Porsche. It was designed at a time when VW was over engineering their cars and that's reflected in basic items like thick door hinges made from cast metal and complex sub systems like the 4Motion all-wheel-drive, which is the same as Audi's quattro system. Does this sound like a formula for high-volume sales success? No. If, however, you approach your vehicle purchases from a different angle than most people the Touareg might feel just right.",1
"I bought the sports edition and like everything about it. The ride, the back up camera, and the touch screen. I won't rate it a 5 Star because the paint is not thick or strong enough as it scratches very, very easily.",1
"I strongly disagree with the other review.  I've not spent barely a penny on mine.  My only complaint is that it's a bit loud.  Not quite as luxurious as my Infiniti's I've owned.  Still gets great gas mileage at 42-48 mpg.

I have 70,000 miles on it now and still have not even replaced the brakes. I do have the upgraded version with navigation, leather and chrome wheels.",1
Solid vehicle good mileage quiet comfortable drive. Don't like the OnStar Nav system. You have to contact OnStar to use it.,1
"Great little suv! Have had mine since 2013 and have loved it. Fits a lot of cargo with the rear seats down and there is a small stow away when they are down. Drives and handles great and has good mpg on the highway if you add a chip and a k&n air filter. Have only had to replace the brakes, ball joints and tires since my purchase. Has a rust issue with these tho. Notorious for rust on the bottoms of the doors and the rocker panels. If you can find one that's been garage kept and has little rust issues, buy it!!",1
"I own a 2016 SLE double cab, Z71 4x4, tow and value packages, 5.3ltr, 6 speed, 18"" wheels, black. I don't pull,or haul a ton with it but I have loaded it up a couple times. I commute and I've had it on a couple road trips.
I got a great deal last October on some of the last 2016s available.
Truck rides great and it's plenty comfortable. Great ride means for a truck, it's still stiff/bouncy compared to a cer. The cloth/nylon seats are very stain resistant and look good too. Absolutely no sign of wear coming up on 8000mi.
Easy to drive and good visibility mostly. Came with heated front seats, work great. Fold up 60/40 rear seat but the floor is uneven so it's still awkward to stow stuff there and the rears don't fold down.
Sound system and Bluetooth integration are good. No navigation but all GM have onstar which you can do what's called ""turn by turn"" directions which really does work pretty good. I let onstar lapse after the trial. Truck has a wireless network which I like and pay 10/mo for 1Gb of data. The weird part is that of course it uses a cellular signal and there is no indicator of the signal strength so you can't rely on it 100%. Duel climate works great and it's the best system I've ever used.
Here's some things I think GMC needs to work on:
$45,000 and no glovebox light? Really?
The turn radius really sucks!
Auto up on ALL the windows.... so annoying.
A 16,000 Hyundai has a locking fuel door (need I say more?)
Center stack electronics have acted up on me a couple times. Sometimes it will read txt messages and sometimes not. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes for my phone to connect. I've had the system crash twice while driving. It reboots but it's weird. Is a call fail to connect, the message will not go away on its own like all other messages. It's got a nice 8in display and it will,play movies, as long as you not driving. There's icons for everything on the screen but not Sirius/XM. Vehicle advisor couldn't even figure that out. You have to keep pushing ""radio"" button to get it.
So I do really like the truck and would buy it again no problem. I hope GM work to fix or add the things that should really be on all cars.",1
comfortable car family friendly lots of space and compartments for everything,1
"So far really like it, do have some small problems that need to be repaired, but like the SUV, and I already knew that MPG wasn't to great, but is okay for me as I am retired now, so do not drive that much.",1
"A wonderful purpose built machine. I've yet to use or own a vehicle that is nearly as off-road capable in its stock form as a Wrangler; I've been told that Toyota Land Cruisers come pretty close, though (no personal experience with those, however).

TL;DR, Wranglers are nearly unstoppable when off-roading, and are certainly nice to have on beautiful days since the roof can be removed, but they lack comforts that most drivers would expect, particularly when one considers how they tend to command a higher price than many other vehicles. They are generally reliable as long as it has been well-maintained, and they are a breeze to work on since they are relatively simple machines with particularly expansive engine bays. They're fun vehicles, but if you are only able to have one vehicle and plan on daily driving it long distances, I can't recommend it.

There is a certain satisfaction to owning a Wrangler and although they often lack many creature comforts like A/C, power locks and windows, anti-lock brakes (in my case), and a decent sound system, they are truly incredible at doing what they're built for. That having been said, I can't recommend a Wrangler as a daily driver for most people due to its lack of comfort, truly horrible gas mileage, lack of sound deadening, and generally simple, or even crude, feeling about it (sacrilege, I know).

I want to mention the ride first by saying that it's bouncy. Very bouncy. Yet, despite being bouncy, it's not particularly shock-absorbing and can be quite jarring at times. I realize that this has to do with it being built for off-roading, but it should still manage to be comfortable on the road, should it not? (hint: it's really not.) Partially linked to the ride; it's rather loud inside the cabin due to the lack of sound deadening of any kind. With a soft top like mine, above ~45mph one practically has to yell to be understood by passengers. Especially passengers in the back seat, yelling will be absolutely necessary to be understood by them. To be fair, the hard top models are better in this regard than the soft tops, but they are still quite loud at highway speeds, regardless. Also, a side-effect of this, you can forget about listening to music while driving on the highway in a soft top, because you won't be able to hear anything but screeching highs once you've maxed out the volume. It's downright painful and I promise that you won't do it more than a few times.

Moving on to the fuel economy... It's not great. I live in East Tennessee, so there is very little in the way of flat ground and that severely impacts my fuel usage. I've heard that Wranglers can get as much as 18mpg (woohoo for efficiency!), but I average between 10 and 13 miles-per-gallon depending on how much of my driving can be done on highways, which is often very little. Keep in mind that this is while in 2wd, when in 4wd the mpg drops to single digits. Yeegh.

Speaking of the 4wd system, it's excellent. It seems well-built and performs well in most environments, be it snow, mud, or loose rock. Sand and particularly sloppy mud can be problematic, but no Jeep is complete without a winch, so that is a must and it will get you out of those situations where you might get stuck. These Wranglers also might as well be snowmobiles in deep snow when the 4wd is engaged, because they can still drive and climb things as if there was no snow at all. It's incredible, really, and very confidence inspiring. All that said, with improper tires to handle winter weather and arduous offroad conditions, the performance of this system is severely handicapped. That ought to be a no-brainer, but it should be mentioned nonetheless.

The 4.0L I6 is the only engine that a Jeep Wrangler should ever have, despite its truly atrocious fuel economy, it's a solid and very reliable engine when properly maintained. Furthermore, the engine bay is spacious enough that maintenance is as much of a chore as on some other vehicles. Better still, because Wranglers are relatively simple machines, much of the maintenance can be completed by those who have little experience wroking on vehicles. These are great vehicles to learn on since they rarely, if ever, require special tools or the body of a contortionist to perform maintenance. The only time I had trouble working on mine was when I had to drop the transmission to replace the clutch, as there were some cables on the top of the transmission that needed to be removed, but they were hard to reach. Just about everything else is pretty simple though!

Overall, Wranglers are great, but they do not function well as a daily driver unless you have the free time to offroad them and the extra cash to fuel them. They're expensive, unrefined, and sometimes harsh, but wow are they fun. I also forgot to mention that there seems to be a sort of 'Jeep Club' that owning a Wrangler gets you into. There is a sort of camraderie among Jeep enthusiasts that seems to be in the same vein as Harley-Davidson owners and it's strange at first, but it's also really cool how owning a certain vehicle can attract fellow owners.",1
"Great handling, torque and power curve. Very reliable and fun to drive.",1
"Outstanding vehicle, fun to drive, great handling and surprising quick, but not fast. I enjoy the body style on this particular vehicle. If you do your homework on previous maintenance and understand what to do and what not to do, this is a great and reliable vehicle. Beware and stay away from those who have not done the major hiccups on this model. Instrument cluster should have been replaced as this was an issue with the older TT along with the usual timing belt and water pump. If these things have been addressed in a timely manner, fire away and prepare for a fun ride!!!",1
"I bought this van in 2003 with 20k miles on it from a dealer. I think it had been a rental, it has an Avis sticker inside drivers door. It was very clean. I had looked at one several years before but did not get it because my wife didn't like the small passenger footwell. I used it the month I got it to haul a load of tools 800 miles and my son used it to haul friends on a ski trip. I have been hauling everything in it since then, that's its strong point. Room, for a mini van. Fourteen years later and I am still driving it as a second car. I have only put 68k miles on it, a total of 88k. I have pulled, U-Haul trailers, their smaller one, sailboat, pop up camper, now hauling a Jayco 165 camping trailer, about 3500 lbs. I have looked at newer small vans and none fill the niche this one does and most cost $40k. Sorry Chevy stopped making it in '05. At the rate I am putting miles on this one I will be driving it another 25 years. My wife is laughing!!!!! Her feet are still cramped.",1
Met,1
"A nice little car, very sporty looking. The best thing about this car is the plastic body that will not rust! The worst thing about this car is the small 1.6 engine that doesn't have much power. The gas mileage isn't as great as it should be for such a small engine. But it's still a great car for normal commute, but not great for long distance driving.",1
Great for large families and long distant trips. Had problems with ignition coils when we first bought it used but once resolved it has been our family wagon now for over 6 years.,1
"My 2001 Nissan Altima GXE  had only one issue in the last 15 years and that was covered under warranty. The intake manifold had to be replaced within several years of my purchase. It now has 105,000+ miles on the odometer and is driving very well. I use this Nissan much less because we have a newer car. Let me say I have absolutely no regrets with this 2001 Nissan. It's been a wonderful car and uses not a drop of oil.",1
I bought my 1990 Saab Turbo convertible last summer. It's in original condition and runs beautifully since I had the cooling fans fixed and radiator replaced. It needs a few minor repairs but the engine and transmission are strong. Love taking it for drives with the top down.,1
"The ride is NOT smooth, It's an adjustment to learn to handle the steering with it's shorter wheelbase - but it's so much fun!  Can't wait for the snow to get out of the mountains we we can get into them!!!!",1
This is a good little SUV! it drives like a car but the awd makes it very capable off road while still getting good gas mileage.,1
good car except for the area of sight . There are a lot of blind spots,1
"I bought this car new. 2013 Rallye 1.4 liter MultiAir Turbo with 6 speed Manual Dual Dry Clutch. Like the car a lot. Very reliable. Some minor issues. Major issues covered by warranty.

Pros: Bluetooth, peppy turbo, lots of space, sporty look, price, very good gas mileage
Cons:  faulty electrical, turbo failed at 30,000 miles, came with very cheap tires,

After 30000 miles, the turbo died. It was covered in the power train warranty. The Dodge dealership took a week to fix it.
In the NJ summertime (90-100 degrees) and wintertime (0-20 degrees), the guages on the dashboard will not always work.",1
"There was no alteration, fit perfect",1
It rides very smoothly. Only con I have is parts like handles and windows a little weak.,1
Spacious and comfortable vehicle tremendous ride and towing capacity.,1
"Excellent truck. Can handle anything I can throw at it. Ride is a little rough but well worth it. Classic Toyota reliability. The only downside and the reason for four stars is that the T100s were a marketing flop for Toyota. They were sold as full size trucks but smaller than the competition and not initially offered with a V8. This makes parts somewhat hard to find. All in all though, well worth it!",1
gas mileage only minus,1
Great on gas and its smaller then the full size trucks and i will buy another once the deisel comes out.,1
"Pretty good, I have the 6 speed manual transmission with the 3.7L V6. Up to about 153k with some bumps along the way but still a pretty good vehicle considering I bought it at 19k. Brakes and tires as you would expect in a smaller suv. Changed cat under warranty at about 85k. Changed water pump (common for jeeps and an easy fix) at 105k. Sat for two years when I was without a license. Changed radiator at 135k(again not a hard job). Just had throw out bearing and clutch replaced at 152k. Driven daily and all over NYS, NH, VT, MA. Driven off road in rough conditions, muddy, snowy/icy, through standing water 2 1/2/3 ft deep. Towed several boats, enclosed 16ft trailer. Hauled many deer, lots of firewood, moved with it several times. A little rough ride these days at 150k+ but still gettin the job done.",1
"Bought used with 93,000 miles. Body style stayed almost exactly the same through the 2016-17 model years or close to it.  Engine has incredible power. Close to 300bhp in 2009. I think the AWD model would be a great investment. Replaced collision sensor, washer pump, led headlights and led interior lights very easily myself.  Part were super affordable on Amazon. Nice car to customize. Good smooth ride. Gas mileage around 20 in town. Lots of gadgets, navigation, and audio choices like satellite radio, hard drive storage , and inputs for charging cell phones and other accessories. No Bluetooth audio from your phone in 08-09 model years. Possible dealer update? Great seat heaters and steering customization. Pretty good blind spots for this wagon, not too much an issue when parking and leaving a crowded parking space thanks to the parking assisted cameras everywhere. Helps one stay in the lines easily. Many useful features like speed sensing wipers, auto entry lights come on at night when one approaches the car, just have the fob on you and the car lights up when near. Car sits high enough to help see around most other cars, but low enough to really take corners and maneuvers without body roll like some crossovers or smaller SUVs.  Tires were reasonable as were oil changes. Insurance was also not too bad.",1
"Pros: Amazing gas milage, lots of interior room for its size, comfortable ride.

Con: poor acceleration even with power mode on, cheap feeling interior materials, still getting use to the unique design, the beeping while in reverse is a needed annoyance.",1
"This car has been Big Fun since I bought it almost nine years ago. Reasonably reliable too, though I have had to sink some money into it as it's gotten older. It gets pretty bad gas mileage with the 3 liter six, but no doubt some of that is due to my being unable to resist putting the pedal to the metal so often. My car's a red Spyder GT, WAY cooler than Amazon's stock photo.",1
"Overall I enjoy the vehicle. Rides and runs very well. Have over 82,000 miles on it and it has been very dependable. My only complaint would be gas mileage. As usual it's not what they advertise.",1
Comfortable to drive with plenty of pep. Transmission can be a little rough at times.,1
Nice bells and whistles. Certainly great looking. Hate the 6 speed transmission. It gets confused all the time!  I love gm and I think they could have done better.,1
Lots of room compared to a Chevy express.  Better seats. Better layout.  Cheap components though.  Seatbelt covers break easily. Arm rests wearing down quickly.,1
Bought used in 2005 still drive daily.  Only reason 4 star because Ford caused a transmission leak when they did a torque converter factory recall a few years back and it cost me to repair the leak.,1
"I bought my RAV4 used last year around this time after driving a tiny Chevy Cavalier for a couple of years. I have to say, it was quite the improvement. It drives very nicely and is very roomie inside, both in the front and back seats. My only complaint is that the middle seat in the back is kind of a joke. The seatbelt interferes with the one right next to it and actually getting three people back there is difficult. This is especially true for those of us who also need to consider car seats. I'd love to install my 3 year old's car seat in the middle, however, getting a tight install that wouldn't interfere with the other seatbelts, would be difficult to accomplish.

Otherwise, I enjoy this car and it does a great job getting me from ""Point A"" to ""Point B.""",1
My father bought the '97 Ford Ranger new and I purchased it from him about a year ago (Spring 2016). For a 20 year old vehicle with only 103k miles on it I really can't complain. The a/c is out but as this is just my Lowe's / Home Depot truck to haul stuff around in that's not a big deal. The steering gear box needed replaced as the original had an unacceptable amount of slop in it which is not unusual for the age of the Ranger. After driving it for about 6 months I had the entire hydraulic / clutch system rebuilt and it runs like a champ now. The electric window motors are a bit sluggish but still work for the time being.,1
Rides great. Solid Car.,1
"Good car. It does have some minor annoyances such as bad windshield wipers, window motor regulators going bad, and abs becomes non functional at random times. Great otherwise.",1
"It's a very comfortable vehicle, stable, tough, the engine has a very good response, the gas per milage isn't great,  but it's ok",1
"I love my TT.....It's got 227.000 and  knock on wood, it's given me only slight problems. I keep the oil changed regularly and it's fun to drive...... kids are always pulling up beside me on the interstate and want to race me though LOL",1
"I love my Crown Victoria, the car is reliable and the space inside is hard to beat. I will likely keep the vehicle for as long as I can, especially considering how cheap all of the parts are.",1
Love this truck but if you get one from the Midwest be prepared for rust and seized bolts. I get compliments on it every time I drive it. Great in snow and on street.,1
I have the ZR2 model and it is great but for the gas mileage it gets. About 15 combined so its a little price to drive but a heck of a lot better than my 2500HD all the time.,1
"the Benz is over 90% restored , paint is good and the interior is  good .needs some leaks fixed and some instrument work done , but the car is solid",1
"I have the SVT version; 200hp V6 5-spd. Total sleeper that goes squarely against the BMW M3 of the same year. Handles AWESOME. A FWD that oversteers; need I say more? Quiet, quality interior that's ideal for a quality sound-system until you wake the engine up over 4K rpm. ;)  Not the easiest drivetrain to work on as that V6 was shoehorned in. Avoid sunroof version as they are problematic.",1
"I've got this truck new last year and after 11,000 miles it still does what I expect from it. It's an SV king cab, 2wd, V6, 6 speed manual. It's an ""old"" design and that's why I wanted it. Don't expect crossover like gas mileage. If you're really worried about that, you don't need a truck to begin with. I see 19mpg combined and 22mpg highway, good enough for me. Power is very good throughout the rpm range and it rides, stops, and steers decent. For a sticker price of a little over $25,000 which included basic power accessories, heated seats, spray in liner, etc, this truck is a deal. Try to touch a comparable Tacoma or Colorado/Canyon for that. You can't.",1
Great truck. Strong power train.,1
"Great full size truck!!! Bad on gas, but it is a big truck with the reliability of a Toyota. If Toyota could build a full size truck with a bit better fuel mileage, the tundra would definitely get a 5 star rating.",1
Still a Smooth ride.  Moderate Electronic ignition issues but runs smooth.,1
"Overall great car for the price. Has a ton of features like navigation, touch screen radio, xm, CD player, sunroof, nice subwoofer from the factory. Gets pretty good gas mileage at around 25 mpg. Plenty of room to haul all of my guitar equipment around.",1
This minivan is the best thing since sliced bread!  My only complaint is the mechanisms that operate the sliding doors are a joke. Each door has broken several times and is quite pricey to fix. Each door costs about $700 to make usable again. There are several things that can go wrong but no matter what breaks the price to repair remains the same.,1
"This is the same as a 2001 Honda Civic, I have both and in the mornings couldn't tell the difference so I would just grab a pair of keys and go. I guess I would buy again",1
"After about 60k miles, and every day driving, I still love this truck. I was a Ford guy for many years, but after many front end, transmission and various other issues...I bought a Ram. Glad I did. Just climbing into this Hemi powered beast puts a smile on my face. This thing is FAST...with excellent pulling power...oh and that sound...nothing sounds like a Hemi. Ive had virtually no issues with this truck, its been a rock solid performer so far. Ive added some aftermarket parts to aid its stellar performance.
The best thing Ive done so far was shocks...factory shocks were horrible. So, I installed Bilsteins 1500 series all around (load leveling in front) and Air Lift bags in rear (for hauling/towing). Truck rides and handles Great!
Next Brakes...PowerStop Extreme Tow and Trailer...slotted and drilled. Well, you still reading...go get a Ram...youll love it!",1
So far so good,1
"Love my Coupe.
Pluses are that it came pre-installed with Bluetooth and steering controls. I had to find and install an updated DME, but it was plug and play.
I have 07 front and rear rims with low profile tires. You tend to feel the road more, but corning is so much fun. When using the Sport shift option, it enhances the drive even more.
Bought it with 68k, after two years I have 75k.
The wife prefers to drive it over her 03 X5.
The stereo system is ok. Have also installed XM radio. Radio comes pre-programmed to work with Sat.",1
"Great car, excellent interior and sound system. Great power with an obd2 chip mod but maintenance is really expensive. It can break you",1
"I absolutely love my Camaro!  Classy, stylish, great performance!",1
I love my car.,1
"A/c control works intermittently. Steering has slop even after ball joint,control arms,tie rods, idler arm, steering box and intermediate  steering shaft replaced. The slop is in the column itself.",1
Good car,1
"I've got the double cab Off road long bed 4x4.....So far solid truck. Minor quality issue with the epoxy that holds the hood to the hood frame. It appears the epoxy is not holding in some areas and causing the hood to slightly vibrate at highway speeds. I'll get that fix at the 5K service under warranty. Other than that it is what I expected.....a truck with some comfort features....but make no mistake.....it's a truck...it handles like a truck and rides like a truck....so don't expect it to ride like a SUV or car. The ride is well dampened at low speeds but the Off road Bilstiens don't do as well with high speed damping at highway speeds.

 JBL sound system is good for my 50 year old ears but not amazing if you pump the volume up to the 75% range or higher.

Overall I'm happy with the purchase though the quality/fit and finish isn't as nice as my 2002 4Runner...which was nearly perfect.",1
In-expensive transportation. So far it has been pretty dependable.,1
"I've had this car for about 4 years now and I still get excited about the car when I drive it. It is extremely quiet and smooth on the road, due to excellent suspension system from Lexus. Roomy on the inside and beautifully designed on the outside makes this car one of the best cars I've ever owned.",1
"What I like the most is that when it comes to gas and maintenance of 2003 Pontiac Vibe it is very economical. I service my car twice a year by personal Mechanic, which works for me, and the car runs good!!! Since I live the city, it runs great. The least thing I like about is the headlights at times gave me trouble, but fixable",1
We'll I like the truck but the electrical is crap especially this mess of o2 sensors and knock sensors,1
"It's a great little commute car. It gets great gas mileage {28~30 city, up to 35 hwy} Goes well thru the snow, easy to park.
One down side to this is that if it's windy out, the car gets blown all over the road (really noticeable at Hwy speed)
Beings it's a small car, it would be a great car for beginner drivers.  It is relatively inexpensive car, as far as insurance rates and replacement parts goes. We have two , 2005 Aveo. Both had hit deer within four months of each other and got replacement parts at a salvage yard, cheap, and are the same color as car {so no painting required}  and both needed timing chain replaced around. 120k miles,  most likely well past manufactures suggested time, other than those things, no other major things went wrong. (besides expendable items -  tires, brakes etc)
Great little cars. One has 160k, other. 208k. We've had them since '07, other.' 08,  so some time now.  To bad they aren't being made any more.  The replacement car from Chevy is the Sonic (which we bought one new in. '14) we have 6 cars {3 in family}  I actually traded one in for the sonic, but bought back the next day.  We were actually looking for new truck and showing my wife what the replacement to the Aveo was, and bought new car.",1
would like it to open a little slower but worked good and had some trouble with the anchor that goes in the tail gate turning when you go to tighten it so the 9 turns was not accurate,1
"Fits perfectly for 2012 Jeep Compass but same thin metal than original part.
The original CVT filler metal tube shouldn't have broken off by itself in the 1st place as it's one metal piece! Happens more than you'd imagine; 'luckily' it stuck/fell out of the engine protection shield slid otherwise it would not have been detected causing transmission issues over time ....see the Jeep forums however I called FCA center is not aware of such and no recall (what a joke!), replace on your own dime when after 36K miles out of warranty.",1
Love it,1
"We purchased our Mazda 3 hatchback in 2007 new from the dealership. The car is amazing. Super fun to drive, great fuel economy, great and the hatchback configuration makes it extremely versatile for hauling all types of stuff from camping gear to bikes. We now have 180,000 miles and I've only done routine maintenance. The one major flaw with the car has been that it started burning oil somewhere around 80,000 miles. it burns one quart per thousand miles. That rate has not increased ever since it started doing it but it is a pain in the rear end to add oil every thousand miles. We have a super honest mechanic that never encourages us to do unnecessary work and he said to just leave it alone.",1
No comment.,1
"Great car, very easy to work and tough. Parts are also inexpensive so makes working on an older car like this easier.",1
"I really think I made the right decision when it came to getting a new SUV. That's not to say that I haven't had problems like a lot of fellow owners have. My navigation has failed on two occasions. The first was about 10k miles, and it showed me about three miles away from where I actually was. I took it to the dealer, and the unit was reprogrammed. it happened again at around 17k miles, but this time my compass was facing the opposite direction, and it showed me 90 miles in the wrong direction. The service dept. found that there was a short in the unit, and replaced it under warranty. Aside from those, I have had no other electrical issues, nor have I had transmission issues. The only other issue I've had so far are with the factory tires- I had to get 4 new tires at 19k miles after I developed a leak in my P-R tire. The mechanic (independent from Jeep) said that there was a high level of wear on all four. Now, when I look at reviews of those tires, I do see some that point to a lower tread life than usual. I noticed that Jeep actually uses a different brand of stock tires now- Goodyear.
A gripe I have is that Jeep will not fully update their Uconnect systems the way Ford has done. There are new features on the '16 model Uconnect system that only apply to the '2016 cars. It is the same generation car, and same generation infotainment system. Uconnect claims the older model years' systems can't handle the update, but Ford has had no problem upgrading their Sync systems down to systems that were generations older.

Other than the issues, I think the car looks great, drives nice (sport mode is a little rough when it changes gear for sure), and is quite comfortable for the segment. Since I have had few problems with the technology, it is a welcomed change in my book. From the responsive 8.4"" touchscreen, to the 7"" TFT gauge cluster, and back, it all just works. I do not regret the purchase, even after the issues I've had.",1
good truck if you do not mind the 11.5 mpg city 15 mpg interstate,1
"Pros: fuel economy, cargo space, electronic amenities, style
Cons: road noise, ground clearance, would have preferred leather seats

Over all I love this car. I drive a lot for work in fact I've put 45000 miles on my car in two years it still runs like new. If you need an economical car that has lots of cargo space this is the one!",1
"I was fairly lucky with my Cutlass.  I got it from my friend who sold it to me with the front bumper not installed.  His son was in a car accident.  It cost me $500 to have it welded back on.
My car had 69,000 miles on it when I got my 20 year old car.  It rides smooth.  I'm 6'4"" and it has just enough leg room for me.  If you're taller than 6'5"", you might get leg cramps if driving long distances.

The best thing is, parts are cheap and if you can find an honest mechanic on Craigslist, or if you want to spend the $20 on a repair manual, these cars can last a long time.

They're kind of ugly, even for 1995",1
"I love my car has a lot of power, is fast, comfortable and has a stylish line. The sound system eventually became obsolete and I should update it. Air conditioner system is not excellent if you live in areas with warm weather. Over time maintenance costs increase but despite the age is still a reliable and pleasant car to drive.",1
"These cars a lot of fun but be prepared to pay for it!

Mechanical parts are simple to get (I am in Australia) but body parts are another story. All the items I have purchased from Amazon have been for the Thunderbird and have been used to build the engine again, plus a bit of fluff.

I can only suggest that you get the best car you can afford and join a car club.

cheers Graeme",1
"It would be easier to tell you what I don't like. I don't like the change oil sensor. If you do your own oil change, you can not reset the sensor. I don't like the rear doors. My next truck will have the doors open the same direction. If you are parked and are loading something. It is very hard especially when someone is parked next to you, say at the grocery store. Those are the only things that I don't like.",1
"25 years old and still runs like a champ. Terrible gas mileage but i didn't buy it with fuel economy in mind. I bought it to drive over, or through, things.",1
"Good all-around truck. Does what I expect out of it. Tows a 16' trailer and a zero turn mower good. I have added a 2""lift to front and 1"" to rear and added 265/75/16 tires.",1
Nice car good price,1
Great truck except for the tipm that dodge decided was the best idea for headlight controls,1
"I purchased mine at 269,000 put new heads on it cause the old ones failed due to a manufacturing flaw that all the 3.0 v6 have.  And now I'm at 281,000 and she's still going strong.  I'll be honest I've beat the absolute piss out of this truck and it starts everytime and I've never had a problem with it.  Other than the normal stuff of course.",1
"Last real Jeep Wrangler.  Although, I'm quite interested in upgrading to a newer model.  Just don't want to let go of ""Syble.""",1
I am in love with this car. It is very reliable. I have owned other model vehicles before and they can't compare to a Subaru.,1
Love every thing about the 2500 HD except the gas millage. I have the 6.0 and it looks like 11.5 per gallon.,1
"The R seems to me one of the more underrated classes from Mercedes. The best I can figure, it's release wasn't timed or advertised well. To some people it looks too much like a minivan, to those that don't mind minivans it doesn't get good enough fuel economy.

The good:
* Seats 6 or 7 depending on second row configuration.
* The second row is just as roomy as the passenger seat.
* The third row can actually, comfortably, fit a real life adult!
* The ride is very comfortable and smooth.
* With the third row Stowed, there's tons of storage.
* Panorama sunroof is awesome!

The bad:
* Handling could be better. It does drive a bit like a boat.
* With the third row up, there is minimal storage (but - that's what I wanted when we bought it! We handled that with a hitch and platform)
* Road clearance is minimal. It's definitely NOT an SUV and will occasionally make that known.
* Fit and finish is less luxury and more economy.
* the fuel economy isn't good. We're talking 15-17 city and 19-20 highway real-world.

The ugly:
* Random squeaks, pops, and rattles seem to be par for he course with the panoramic sunroof.",1
"I love mine. Paid $450 for mine over 2 years ago. Still driving it after I put 13,000 miles on it. Did make adapter plate and convert it from tbi to carburetor and hei distributor.",1
Been a great car. Owned it since new. I drive it like I stole it and it's keeps on going.,1
Good Low Cost Low Maintainence Vehicle. Leather Seats Add Comfort.,1
"I've had mine almost a decade now and it's still running like I first bought it. I bought it at 35,000 miles and it's now at 125,000. I've had issues with oil leaks by the front left axel and I've heard of people having it on the other as well.
I also had a oxygen sensor issue at one point, which made the engine rev in weird ways at times. Pretty easy to clean once you know where to look. I'm still amazed at how it's still running though. I've driven it pretty hard at times and it's taken me from the west coast to the midwest multiple times now.
I've also loaded it with a lot of weight in the past, both inside and on top with the racks and the racks hold up very well.

There are some cheap parts they use that wear down quickly. Plastic liners on top have flown away, the screws that hold down the carpet are plastic and get worn down easily, the hub caps all flew off years ago, and the door handles wear down over time and WILL fail on you and will need to get replaced.

But otherwise I'm still amazed I still have it and it still gets the same mpg that it was originally rated to get.
Other than the issues I'v had with it, some of which I may have caused, it's been a great, reliable vehicle.",1
Axles and ball joints are something that need to be replaced,1
Best vehicle ever.,1
"A fantastic truck bought new in 91 and have 85,000 miles on this 4 x  4 v8 engine vehicle......mileage is good at 1.8 around town and about 19 on the highway.....would do it again.....",1
"I bought it new in 2005 it had the roush appearance package only paid 21,5. It had transmission problems immediately at 3000 miles . I took it in 5 times and told them what was wrong it was only the overdrive that was bad got a new transmission put in it after a little threatening but have 158000 on it now hasn't had any other issues other than regular maintenance and still driving it and pulling my boat.",1
I love everything about my Jeep liberty sport 4 x 4 except it's terrible gas mileage.,1
"Due to it being a 4-banger, it's a great first car. Not a bunch of power and not a crazy amount of torque. The cars very approachable and manageable. Unless you really try, it's kind of difficult to speed, you keep your foot in one place and it will literally go the speed limit. Yeah the looks aren't the greatest, in fact it's downright hideous. But as a first car, it's great on gas mileage and it very simple to drive and maintain.",1
Very good on gas!,1
"It's been a great car, great gas mileage, responsive.  Back seats fold down which gives you tons of room to pack things.",1
Bought these for daughter's Matrix. They came packed nicely and assembly and application a breeze. They look great.,1
Product fits and looks good an mirrors are tight and don't vibrate. Mirrors did start to come off at 75mph. I caught it. Not sure if it would have come completely off but it moved so mirror was useless. Plan on zip-stripping it down to hold in place.,1
"I've owned this truck since 2005. I do mostly city driving with an occasional long trip.  Gas mileage is pretty terrible but maintenance has been fairly minimal.  I've changed out the original slip yolk to remove the ""thunk"" that all of these models have.  I also changed out to the new design steering shaft and bearing that eliminates the steering clunk that all of these have.  The truck only has 92k miles in 2017 but so far, so good.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a dependable used truck if gas mileage isn't high on your priority list.",1
"Overall, I am very happy with this car. It is built in the US but around 50% of the parts are US/Canada. There are several things that I like about it and a few things that I dont. To begin, I bought this car with 30k miles (certified preowned) and now with over 3 years, it has 65k miles. It is a LT sedan version. I really like the interior and exterior design of the car. More specifically, I like the individual headlights. On a headlight, there are 2 sperate circles that look very nice. The lower deflector is about 5in off the ground which at times is a small problem. Depending on the angle of the road, if I go too fast, I will scrape the bottom of it against the road. I have to back into my driveway in order to avoid this when pulling out. Another problem is that there is no engine temperature gauge.  Under the hood, everything looks well organized and it looks like there is room to work on it if there needs to be a repair done. I had to get a torx socket set to do a few repairs. The word airbag appears 12 times. The car has your standard 2 front airbags as well as side windows, knee, and side seat airbags which is a nice safety feature.

Performance wise, this car is good. The brakes on the car are very good. The car would nose dive into the ground when the brakes are slammed. The car is very responsive. The thing that I like the most about this car is the handling and suspension. I am able to make very hard turns without feeling like I am about to go off road. I am able to dodge Chicagos large potholes and flying debris on I-55 very easily. This car is very fun to drive especially if there are a lot of turns. It has a nice turn diameter which makes parallel parking a bit easier. Comparing it to a Honda Civic, I am able to make a turn at 33mph while with the Sonic at 46mph (both vehicles equipped with same tires). The stock tires are not very good. I had a lot of fun sliding around with them in heavy snow. One thing that I don't like is that the valve cover is plastic. This car goes up hills very well. It holds the speed and rpm while going up a smooth hill. When you switch from drive to reverse on the auto transmission and press the brake hard enough, the car will be in neutral. If you are on a hill, it will roll until you hit the gas or hold the brake. I have the 6-speed automatic transmission which is for the most part smooth. There is a manual mode where you are able to shift gears by the push of a button. The acceleration on the first 2 gears are a bit slow compared to the other gears. The thing that I like is that this car does not have a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and I would never want to see a CVT in a Sonic.

The fuel efficiency on this car is very good. For city, I get around 31-32 mpg and on the highway, I get around 46-48 mpg. If I go over 80 mph, then the fuel efficiency will drop significantly. During the winter, the fuel efficiency does go down a little. It does alright in the snow and freezing temperatures. The tank holds about 12.2 gallons but I would like it to be a bit bigger. The fuel gauge that the car has is a digital one and for every rectangle/parallelogram on that gauge, it represents 1 gallon which is nice because it gives me a good estimate on how much gallons I have in the tank. This helps when filling up and I don't want to go back in to get my refund.

Overall, this is a comfortable vehicle for 2 people. If there are 5 people, there will be some room issues. I am 5 11 and around 190lb. This car is very comfortable to me especially if I am on a trip for several hours. There is a lot of headroom in the car and it does not feel like a subcompact. The seats are comfortable and the driver seat has a moveable armrest. The armrest looks ridiculous and I would prefer if it did not exist. It is usually quiet while driving in the city and the engine makes a nice sound. At high speeds, there is some noise (depending on tires/road surface) and it goes over potholes well. Another thing that I like is the of features this car has. I am able to connect my phone with Bluetooth. When connected, I am able to run 4 apps with the touchscreen version radio. There are two navigation systems in the car. In addition, I am able to use voice commands which lets me do things hands free. The car has very nice speakers which I like very much. I am able to feel the air hit my leg when the bass drops and see things shaking in the car when the volume is on 18. The car has a USB port which allows me to connect a 32gb flash dive with my music on it.  The car does have an aux port which I never use. There is no cd player but who cares.  Power windows with auto open/close feature for the driver window in my car. The heat works very well. The a/c is alright. Child door lock is just the push of a button located by the stabilizer/traction control button and hand brake. On the steering wheel, I have the cruise control buttons but also buttons that control the radio and phone calls. The car has OnStar (GM vehicles only). I am able to start my car from anywhere just by using my phone. There is plenty of room in the trunk (sedan version) but if the box is too big, it is not getting into the trunk. This happened a few times which I did not like. I had to put it in through the rear passenger door. The same thing happened with a miter saw. The car has built in convex mirrors which help to check my blind spot. This car is at times compared to the Honda Fit but the Fit does not really stand a chance against the Sonic. Minus one star for all the repairs I had to do/waste of time going to the dealer for warranty work. In conclusion, this is a fun to drive car and I would buy another one, maybe a hatchback version though.",1
good car  drives well handles well solid feeling,1
"It's fast and rides good, just a little bit lower to the ground than I'm used to.",1
Pretty good car for the money. I have a GT. It's sporty and fun. Plenty of power.,1
Very smooth,1
Excellent car.  Very quick and handles great.,1

Yellow light,1
This has been a very good truck. I still have drive it as my work vehicle. What has helped has been scheduled oil changes and services.,1
I've had this truck a little over 3 months and I've been very happy with it. It was well taken care of and it quite comfortable for a pickup. It drives great and even though it has the big V8 it's gas mileage isn't too bad for a full size truck. I'm very pleased and look forward to enjoying my truck for years to come. It only had 71K original miles when I bought it.,1
Excellent car for the price. With  12000 miles driving to survive in Houston's concrete jungle. I am getting 32 mpg at the worst and 38 mpg at the best with mixed driving. I do not drive over 80 mph as this cars handeling starts to feel unstable. Follow a 18 wheeler at 60 and the on board mpg read our goes over 50 mpg. I'm too impatient to do that for very long. I didn't give it 5 stars due to the unstable handling characteristics at high speed. Otherwise great car for the price.,1
"I purchased my 2001 Wrangler Sahara, it now has about 145,000 miles on it and is still running strong. Only major issue was the automatic transmission went out at about 100,000 ($1400.00 rebuild). I have kept it factory stock and it does not see off road use. Overall it has been a good vehicle with minimal issues.",1

"I purchased a new 2016 Jeep Cherokee Limited 4 x 2 that was fully loaded- it has all the available options. I really LOVE the ventilated seats (Texas summers are brutal!) and the a/c works great! The only thing I don't like is that you cannot permanently turn off the fuel saving option. I HATE that thing. It's annoying to be at a stoplight and have to wait a few seconds while your car restarts before you can go. I know, whats a few seconds? Well, it's annoying to me. Other than that, I like it. It's smooth, comfortable and loaded with cool technology. The leather seats are okay... my tiny less than 10 pound dog slightly ripped the passenger side seat corner, which is really annoying. I feel like they should be able to stand up to more than that. Geesh. But, Again, overall a cool SUV. A little boring, maybe, for my liking (I am used to sportier cars), but a good solid reliable car.",1
Perfect fit,1
Great little truck pretty reliable and good in the snow and not bad on fuel not to mention just a little bigger than the ranger or s10 or now Colorado so there a little more truck for the most things,1
Bought it brand new in '04. Absolutely the most reliable car I have ever owned. A little noisy on the road but other wise I still love this little car. It can do almost anything. Too bad it will be my last since Honda has discontinued them. ,1
Wouldnt change anything about it other than the handling.,1

"My mom bought this Caravan new at the dealer way back in the day. I remember long family trips in this. But it got older started having problems and it got parked in 2011 and was left neglected. Since I went to school to be an Automotive tech it sort of fell upon me to fix it. In May 2016 it came back to life. Redid the whole cooling system new radiator, radiator cap, water pump, thermostat, new upper and lower radiator hoses. Driver side hub and rotor front brakes, new wiper motor, wiper blades front and rear. New fluids and fresh oil change, new filters. Basic tune up spark plugs and spark plug wires. Drained the old fuel and added Royal purple max clean. New battery and soon new ECM. I am amazed on how this old Caravan turned out 144,000 on the odometer runs and stops fine no warning lights (at that time) only lights on right now are the ABS (right, passenger side) hub and Service engine soon (ECM) everything pretty much works on it. Clear coat is pealing needs to get re sprayed. Biggest problem is the ECM knocks out the whole gauge cluster makes driving sketchy since you can't see your speed, fuel level, coolant temp and you can't see your gear select. Over all not too difficult to work on for basic servicing if you prefer to work on your own vehicles.",1
"Beautiful Truck! Its comfortable, and it eats the highway miles effortlessly! Its big, nimble, and, for the size, gets great gas mileage. The V8 power is great, its very smooth and can haul quite a bit. The technology is awesome, the Bose sound system is pretty solid. There are some flaws however. My biggest gripes are on the lighting, both exterior and interior. Here, Chevy really cut corners. For example, I own '16 the Mid-trim LT model. The sticker price, before rebates and discounts was $57k...not a cheap vehicle. WHY ARE HIDs NOT STANDARD?!? If I am paying over $50k for a vehicle, it should come with HID lamps....and Fog Lamps. The LT comes with neither as standard equipment. My 2005 Neon came with fog lamps! On the interior, the lighting is okay, but the ambient lighting could be a little brighter. The tiny LED bulbs they use for the dome lights are not nearly bright enough. Can someone tell me why there is not a glove box courtesy light? Is that an option on the LTZ? Finally, the rear cargo area. At night, with the 3rd row seats up, its completely dark in the cargo area. Chevy, you couldn't put some cargo lighting back there, built into the lift gate? Come on! My last gripe with this vehicle is the shoddy rear view camera. Its placement does not give you a full view of the rear dimensions of the vehicle, so you really have to look around and use your mirrors...not entirely a bad thing. At night, with poor ambient lighting (street lamps, store lighting, etc.), the back up camera is entirely useless. It is clear Chevy used a poor, cheap camera, and could do much better.",1
"Overall I'm pleased with the van, but as newer vehicles go, you can experience a variety of ""electronic"" issues with it. But so long as your dealership's service department supports you with warranty coverage, then you usually find yourself taken care of. One problem that Chrysler hasn't offered a ""fix"" on though is the whistling noise from the engine compartment (throttle body) when cold starting at temps 25 degrees and below. The dealership service department simply stated ""It's a 'characteristic' of your vehicle."" Another software issue the vehicle had was the heater would occasionally blow cold air with all the settings set to hot and the engine fully heated, but there's a software upgrade to fix that. But one great thing is the ride comfort. I work in an automotive environment, so I get to drive a lot of different vehicles, and these vans are by far the most comfortable ride I've experienced.",1
Better than I expected,1
"I love this truck. I just wish the diesel engine was better designed. It's probably the worst diesel engine on the market. It just hit 98k miles and the pump mounted driver has been replaced at least 5 times. The last time was after I re-positioned the mounting location. Even after moving it and adding cooling fins, it still malfunctioned. Luckily Amazon carries the replacement part for just over $100. I now keep a spare in the glove box.",1
Overall good vehicle.,1

Handles well
I like the way it looks
Low maintenance
Very good gas mileage

CONS:
Not very good in the snow (this is the only reason I do not give it 5 stars)
Bluetooth is not compatible with all phones (oddly enough my 2013 Altima paired up with my phone with no issue - I have the same phone and the 2015 Altima Bluetooth when paired with my phone seems to have a mind of it's own - it works for navigation, but only about 10% of the time for calls)

"Apparently this year Sportage has transmission problems and I did not find out until it started slipping and I read online blogs. Other than that, it is a very well put together vehicle. Very roomy for a small SUV and the AWD performed well in the snow. The engine could be a bit peppier but overall it performs well. If Kia would step up and take care of the transmission issues that are clearly a big problem among certain model years, this could be a really great little SUV.",1

With that issue aside, I have not been disappointed.",1
"Of the mini-vans I've owned over the years, the Honda Odyssey is the best.  I had a couple of minor electronic problems with this car, with all but one of them being repaired at no cost under warranty.  The one that required an outlay of $750 cash was due to a problem with my Sirius XM antenna.  It took a week to diagnose the problem and another week to get a new antenna installed.  The replacement required the entire roof liner and other interior parts to be removed then replaced after the installation  It is because of this antenna problem, which occurred after the 3 year warranty had expired, that I rated the vehicle as a 4 rather than 4.5.  Electronic problems aside, I've been happy with the vehicle's performance except for it's excessive noise level at highway speeds.  Holding a conversation with someone in the second row of seats is nearly impossible when you are moving briskly down the highway.  On the plus side, I get at 24MPG at 70MPH with a very comfortable ride.  The built-in navigation system works extremely well and the large screen makes it easy to see route instructions.  When it comes time to replace this mini-van, Honda will be high on my list of vehicles to consider.",1
Solid Transportation,1
"This has been an outstanding working and traveling truck.  This thing has towed a 5000 lb travel trailer over many thousands of miles, through several states over the years and has been solid.  With that said, a few upgrades had to be added for the axles and cooling, but these have been easy as this is a common truck platform to build on.  When not towing, the vehicle is comfortable and rides well, not quite like a truck.  It is room inside and the leather interior has held up well through 3 kids and what ever abusive items, chain saws, heavy tools, etc, that I have thrown into it.  The electronics inside and out have been solid and the paint has just finally started to oxidize on the top.  My bad, I don't wash it enough and have only waxed it twice.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for the intake manifold leaking issue, but I caught it early.  I have been able to add accessories to the vehicle so now it can be used for logging, and this is not easy work on trucks.  The 350 has been a rock solid motor and seems to have enough power to do what I need it to do.  It can never replace a diesel, but it can hold it's own.  Accessories for this model have been easy to find as well as a few replacement parts I have broken.  Standard oil changes, belt replacements and a checkup by a good mechanic every 50,000 miles helps.  My Yukon has only 105,000 miles, but they are hard earned and working miles.  I get 15-16 MPG, no load, 12-14 mpg, with a 2500 lb trailer, and 9 mpg when pulling a 5000 lb trailer.  I have a new trailer, it weighs about 7000 lbs loaded, and I get about 8-8.5 mpg pulling.  The mileages I get are not from flat land traveling, they are from crossing the cascade mountains, there and back.  P.S.  Get the after market glass headlamps, they bring back the brightness the truck first had when I bought it.",1
Mechanically runs like a top at 150k.  The durability of the factory paint is lacking.  The paint looks like its a matte now,1
Car is reliable and easy to work on. Parts are cheap and readily available. I have the 4cylinder manual transmission and it is lacking some pep upon entering the freeway but you can get used to it. I get about 19-20mpg with 16in rims/larger tires.,1
good stuff i got.,1
Very dependable and room for the whole family. Just installed 3in Suspension lift and 35s,1
"Overall, it's a comfortable reliable car.  The version my wife bought is the base model with the 3500 series V6 (3.5L) with the standard options.  (Personally, I would have preferred the 3600 (3.6L) V6's additional power, and whatever package was needed to get the spoiler, and aluminum wheels.)
For those whom do their own work, the engine bay is a bit tight to work in, when things do need replacing. The two biggest problems that dropped this car from 5 stars to a 4 star review, is: A) The emissions system has required some expensive work involving electronics and professional diagnostic computers.  B) The HVAC system has required several of the blend door actuators to be replaced.  I've done these repairs myself.  (I would love to meet the idiots that engineered the ventilation aystem, and give them a serious piece of my mind, as you almost need to be a contortionist to get to the actuators.  The fan speed module was the latest fix. It was riveted in place, not screwed in, and most tools do not fit in that area.)
Overall, I would trust this car to take me (and my family) on a cross country (multi-state) road trip, and back again, without worry.  My wife uses this car as her daily driver, taking her to work and back.  This Impala seems to average about 20-21 mpg (89 octane) in combined urban/suburban driving conditions.  The interior is nicely laid out.  My only big complaint has to do with driving related cup-holder placement in the front, and the lack thereof, in the back seat area.  This car also does not have a folding rear seat, for added cargo space, but the trunk is still large, with a flat floor.",1
The 1996 Ford Explorer is a good vehicle if it serviced and taken care of.,1
"2018 Round 2.  Hit 241k and still on the road. Few MIL which caused some hair pulling, but was able to resolve them with OEM parts from Amazon. Round 1. The 5 speed manual is the best. Combined MPG averages 25MPG for a 4 cylinder.  Rear jump seats in extended cab are functional and versatile for storage.  Only two downsides are 60/40 bench seat does not recline and space saver tire for spare.",1
"I've always hated fords for obvious reasons...amarican cars in general actually. But for the most part, this is a decent truck.",1
"If it were only a 4 x 4, then I would consider giving it a fifth star.",1
"Overall reliability and cost to operate have been good. The Tire Pressure Monitoring System has been less satisfactory but that may be a function of age of the vehicle. It can cost $150+ to replace a sensor. Three our of four of them have failed. They cannot be ignored due to federal regulations. Otherwise, maintenance cost has been reasonable. Sad to say that after 2009, the Nissan Altima has not met consumer expectations due to reliability and repair costs. Don't know why Nissan does not respond with a better vehicle. When it is time to replace the Altima, I will be looking at a Toyota Camry.",1
"I love my vehicle but the middle seat is the back is almost non existent. I have two big bulky car seats in the back and with those you can't even think of fitting anything in the middle seat. A lot of truck space though which is nice! Drives good, easy to park and back. Very happy with choosing this vehicle. Haven't had any issues with it, and the maintenance is fairly simple.",1
"Overall impression: Great little truck, not too big.

Pros:  Good power with the V6, great power with the V8, 5 speed transmission gives 'ok' mpg.  Seating for 5.  Power rear window!  Great towing capacity*,  I hauled a Harley Davidson Electra Glide(over 750lbs) in the bed, over 800 miles with a bed-extender and the truck barely noticed it.  Great utility with all the bed tie downs and cubbies and you can use the cargo cage to extend the bed with the tailgate, or even get a bed extender to go into the receiver hitch if you need more.  Also the bed is nice and tall compared to other small trucks, notice how the bed is higher than the hood on the truck, it gives a sportier profile, but also provides more utility.

Cons: *U-Haul will not rent if you have one of these.  Solely due to the Firestone tire issue with Ford Explorers that resulted in many lawsuits to U-Haul.  So even though this has the best tow rating for trucks in it's class, you can not rent a U-Haul.  Which really really sucks as with the smaller bed but great towing capacity you'd probably be more apt to just rent a U-Haul if you need to haul something substantial.  So, factor this in, and possibly get your own trailer.  Also they only come with a vinyl floor, so floor mats with a vinyl bottom slide all over on the vinyl floor.  But, the vinyl floor is kind of good thing for trucks to avoid staining a carpet due to using it like a truck.  Tire pressure sensors flake out on long trips, but that's about right for the age of the truck, sensors are strapped to the rim so need to be done by a tire shop.  Also the front bumper pops out every once in a while on the corner, just pop it back in, possibly due to a previous parking lot incident.

We've had the truck 2 years, bought at just under 100,000 miles, here are the repairs we've had:
When bought used, radiator had a pinhole leak, replaced by dealership.
Brakes started to go, master cylinder replaced at dealership, less than $500
Replaced fog lights with led bulbs, condensation in the housing so I went with LEDs and they work good.",1
"it's a reliable car. It is confortable, good room inside  and it has a good response from the engine. For the city the fuel consumption is a bit higher but if you drive it easy (up to 2000 rpm) its a normal  car according its 2.4L. Mine has 90k km with no issues at all. Gadgets inside, for the most technological, are poor, but an upgrade from the makers could solve this problem.",1
"A pleasure to drive, comfortable seating. Horrible fuel mileage,  ( I just had to have that Hemi!) I've had a couple of maintenance issues.  spun bearing in the rear differential would have cost a fortune if I hadn't purchased an extended warranty plan.  Then one day, I couldn't add fuel.  The nozzle kept kicking off like the tank was full.  It would take 20 minutes to add 5 gallons of fuel.  I took it to the dealer and they said I had to buy a whole new fuel tank.  They never could give a reasonable explanation of the ""why"".  Of course this one wasn't covered under the extended warranty. Maybe I was overly generous with the star rating????",1
Second car I had in high school. Was in autoshop and drop a Chevy v-8 327 in it.,1
"This replaced an 11 year old Toyota.  The RAV is RELIABLE.  This RAV has never broken down.
The dealer replaced the front drive mechanism when he found a low level hum and whistle at about 30 thousand miles.
At the same visit he measured the wear on the tires, and recommended considering replacement soon as they was over 80% worn;
there was no hard sell.
To say the least I'm a happy customer who will probably buy another Toyota when this is worn or ten years whichever
comes first.",1
"Though little nugget, bought it used from a family who taked good care of it and we're beating the crap out of it and it keeps on ticking. Only complaint is that it's got a week motor for a 2.0L engine",1
Great product. The instructions sucked.,1

"Fast, dependable , and comfortable.",1
"One of the best SUV.
A tough car extra smooth to drive.",1
"Typical of a used pickup with 98K on the odometer you can expect some things that needed to be fixed. I however notice that GM has problems with some things such as the gear selector readout. This is one thing that should be considerd a safty item and a recall should have been issued to replace or repair it. Its a used truck and other than that there are no real issues with it. This one is as clean as a new one with very little interior wear. It runs well, get terrible milage, and looks good. Wish I could have afforeded a new one...",1
decent low cost car,1
"What I liked the most about my Silverado is the cabin is user friendly ,the truck is dependable and it looks good!",1

Very reliable vehicle.,1
"Not fancy just fast.  100,000 mile, no repair yet.",1
"Good 4WD vehicle with lots of room for people and cargo. Ford is slowly adding luxury features to try to arise to Escalade level, but still short of that....but for $30k differential, Expedition a deal. Negatives include the auto transmission when in 4WD and trying to drive on beach, it bogs down to almost no power...not designed for deep sand driving. Also, the 'Remote Start' turns off the engine when you go to open the door....really stupid. So you acitivate the remote start, go to the vehicle, open the door and it immediately turns off the engine. Now the vehicle gets cold/hot again until you can put all your things in the truck, close all the doors, buckle up the kids, get in the drivers seat, put on your seatbelt, and re-start the engine....defeats the purpose of having remote start. Used to be it stayed on until you hit the brake without the key inserted and turned on...without hitting the brake, remained on while you activated the key. This is annoying enough to me to NOT buy again...Ford....wake up!",1
"Very smooth ride, very dependable.
Watch for the automatic sliding door mechanism. expensive to repair. i had to fix both sides already...",1
SO FAR NO PROBLEMS.,1

"Substandard brake lines.  Subject to failure.  Mine failed on the road after 80,000 miles. Corroded and burst. Should be a recall.
Great all around truck for hauling and towing and moving people.
Z71 is a fairly good off road vehicle.
Mileage is marginal, but for 5000lb truck of this vintage it is normal.",1
"Bought it off CL with lots of miles for $1400
 Have put 35K on it with little issues.
Good on gas and very peppey in 3rd and 4th gear.",1
Generally a good vehicle. I've had 3700 pounds in the back and it didn't bog down one bit. Bad engineering was done behind the front fenders. They used a foam or sponge to dampen any vibration from a supporting metal piece. Unfortunately the foam also holds water that causes the fender to rust out prematurely. If I replaced the fenders I'd use a urethane caulk instead.,1
None,1
Has some minor issues but I love it anyway,1
"I give these trucks an overall rating of 4 stars, I have a 06 F-250 Lariat FX4 extended cab short bed and it's been a good truck to me. It's still all stock except for a aftermarket exhaust and a coolant filter (very important parts for a 6.0) Ford addressed a lot of their engine problems by 2006 but if you're going to be hauling huge trailers around everyday, I think it's a very good idea to spend the extra money and have the head studs and everything fixed. On the plus side of the 6.0 diesel, they have plenty of power being 100% stock for the average person and they also get good fuel mileage compared to any new diesel on the market today. 16-21mpg.  As for the rest of the truck, it's tough as nails, it drives good and rides very nice. And you can't beat the looks of a 06 F-series!",1
"2016 RAV4 Hybrid Ltd., ca.$50K with all packages, shipped from Ohio.
Still not available on West Coast.
I was not offered blind-spot mirrors, running boards, nor cargo hammock.
I bought this car first for the cargo space. Wanted something for camping-& I can almost live in this small SUV.
Second b/c the Toyota warranty is outrageously inclusive- even transferable. Can't go wrong.
Thrid, b/c the Hybrid systems are so much fun. 4th was MPG.
OTOH RAV Hybrid is incredibly heavy.  The garage guys call it ""solid""- weighs about 1.5 tons.
So it sleds  downhills like a dream; but  it's important to avoid even shallow depressions. You'll drop to deep bottom- POW  Just a bit scary, b/c . . . !

Tyres are relative lightweights. Right off I totally burst a front tyre at 3 MPH, rolling off a curb of less-than 3 inches height. The included spare tyre is more scary: 'not approved for speeds above 50MPH' ! Replacement with the standard set will be ca.$800. Wish I'd known all that during negotiations.

Electronics:
Proximity /Parking sensors are fun but need serious re- tuning. 18"" spacing is not a collision at 3MPH.
EXTREMELY frustrating integrated ENTUNE GPS device.
A real GPS system should be an option for safety reasons.
ENTUNE GPS is best at spewing corporate garbage, ie Denny's or Target locations, etc.
Useless for nice restaurants, local manufacturing or community resources (Hospitals, AA)

The ENTUNE system is not intuitive nor complete. I bought the larger screen model - but I cant get the GPS route system to show maps at a practical scale.
It's either so large all I see is a squiggle, or so small there's no recognizable data points.

ENTUNE GPS frequently offfers less-than sensible directions - as if its map is years out of date.
Worst of all: Audio directions can be inaudible b/c there's no volume control- No voice option.

and at freeway speeds the directions are timed for slow driving.
whenever you suddenly need to cross 4 lanes, That's a serious safety issue.

And I dunno how to stop it when it decides on a route. It will easily 'pause'; alterations are less intuitive.  But to Exit the program is almost impossible. I've been able to stop the program just once in the 2 months I've used it. I need to carry all my SoCal maps and ThomasBros' but there's not much space for books,,,",1
270K miles. Transmission has given problems. Been apart twice. It doesn't help that it's a one year transmission. Truck rides smooth for a four wheel drive. Wish I could get better than 12.5 MPG.,1
"Bought replacement rear bumper for my Toyota. Product is well made and easy to switch out. However the the attachment
System was manufactured slightly off thereby causing the bumper to be off center on the truck by an inch. Not a life altering moment but something supplier should be aware of re: quality control",1
Great little truck,1
I live in Montana so winter is full of ice driving. The Subaru goes where ever I want.,1
Good,1
"I love my truck, only downside is I wish it had a little bit better gas mileage",1
"I purchased on 05 new and have had ever since. To be honest, I don't drive it much but I do use it perhaps every week. Mine is a Z71 2x4 with an Inline 5. When the truck was new there were some minor issues (leaking), but the dealer took care free of charge. I replaced the seats with power leather versions, and replaced the head unit with an aftermarket GPS. Since owning the vehicle, I have replaced the head unit with a double din Android unit, which offers all the functionality of new trucks. The cons are that the truck is a bit under powered, and heavier tow payloads can stress breaking more than expected. The ride is stable, but the rear tends to wobble quite a lot. The serpentine belts do have a tendency to squeak. Ive had a few minor electrical problems, such as the rear window motor failing and the break light switch dying, but all were relatively easy to repair. The Pros outweigh the cons in my opinion, which is why I have owned the truck since 2005 and haven't yet upgraded. The truck is reliable, it always starts even if it has been sitting for weeks. Gas mileage is decent, as good as modern-day trucks. The Z71 package includes a lift kit and it really makes a big difference when going off road, and the suspension is more than capable for a  ton payload. The traction control is excellent especially if you only have a 2x4. The design of the truck makes it easy to work on yourself for smaller projects/repairs. Overall, its a solid and reliable truck, but it does lack some of the more refined features available in modern trucks.",1
Love this truck! I have a bumper pull toy hauler (11000lbs) and it pulls it like a champ. I average 16 mph. I got the LTZ with Z71 package and get plenty of admiring looks!,1
The top fits pretty good. Not as tight as the original but the sunroof option is worth it.  Install took some time and if you don't have someone to help you I imagine it would take even longer.  The instructions were pretty good. One of the pieces didn't line up. The whole was misaligned. We had to bend it to make it work.  If you aren't mechanically inclined I would not attempt installing his top.,1
"Great vehicle. Smooth ride, sturdy construction (survived 2 deer with minor damage in 9 months), great mpg. A little small for our growing family and a snug fit for my 6'3"" husband to climb into.",1
Nice work truck,1
"Love this truck. I use  it every day  for work  and family on weekends. Reliable,  comfortable,  beware of the air suspension,  it is extremely expensive to fix. It's also a gas guzzler, apart from those two issues, I  have nothing but love  for my truck.",1
I love my Jeep. It gets me where I need to go. I like that I can switch to 4x4 if I need to. My two year old has plenty of space rear facing. I have replaced ball joints once. Also the underside is rusting faster than we would like.,1
Time to replace Volvo S60 with SUV. Fell in love with Cadillac SLX. Thought I better look around before committing. Turns out the Cadillac was the crush and the Acadia and I were made for each other. One star down for boxiness. And I miss my rain-sensing windshield since I live in Pacific Northwest ....,1
I have own this Xterra since 2007. I bought it as a lease return with 29k miles. This is a great vehicle and I love it. I would have given it 5 stars if it got more than 18 MPG.  But worth the sacrifice...:),1

"The Montero is tough and rugged. Once maintained properly,  this vehicle could get to half a million miles",1
"Overall, a good truck. Bought new in 1999, presently has 160000 miles on it, without ever having a tuneup. Change oil regularly, and have had to replace the fuel pump, and a couple batteries. The only really down thing about the truck is the power windows. I have replaced the drivers side motor and regulator 3 times, and the passengers twice, and also the drivers side switch once. Other than that, the truck has never failed me in 19 years. So I would guess that I got a good deal....",1
"It tows great , drives excellent in the snow , for my needs it has plenty of power.

"Great truck! Some things I like about Ford, some I like about others. All in all, I've had 4 Ford trucks from the Platinum to the XLT. They ride good and don't break down. Gas mileage isn't the best but they are dependable.  Might change after this one to a Toyota next time, just to see what they are like.",1

Love my 4 dr 2004 tacoma.  Very reliable with no mechanical issues.  Negatives are that I don't feel safe driving at freeway speeds of 75 mph or higher because it is a light truck and not really meant for cruising at high speeds and it averages only 15 mpg. But I like the smaller size of the 2004 or earlier tacoma because it is easier to park and it is perfect size if most of your driving is mostly in and around town.,1
"This car traveled 260,000 before I lost the motor. ( which I replaced for 700.00)  They do burn oil, but as long as you check it and keep it at a safe level the car will go forever.  I've been driving it daily for 13 years on my hour commute.",1

"As of April 2016 overall its been a dependable truck.  I've had to replace the blower motor and resistor module, overall cost approximately $135.  Amazon blower motor by far the less costly than Auto parts stores.  I use synthetic oil.  Gas mileage could be better on average I'm getting 16 mpg (highway/town) on a weekly basis.  I should have opted for the 5.3L engine vice the 4.8L.  As with all rear wheel drive truck, the back slides and loses traction on wet payment.  Traction control helps, but seems to lock the rear differential in a quirky way, but releases rather quickly.  From reading recent reviews, the break lines appears to have leaking problems from winter road salt corrosion.  NBST should seriously investigate these reoccurring problems. It rides smooth and having most bells & whistles in the cab is comfortable and a benefit.",1
"Great car! Fun and nimble! Parts are expensive and the rear sub frame is said to crack, which was fixed on the next year's model. But a great car!",1
"Great truck, very easy to work on.",1
I really like my 1500 Ram. The 5.7L Hemi is amazing love the power! Overall it's a great truck. The only thing I really dislike is the rotary dial gear selector!  Thinking about doing some research to see if I can put a center console shifter in my 2014 Ram.,1
Every time  drive it. No matter my mood. This car leaves a smile on my face. Simply love it. I only give 4 stars because it is everything but practical as your only car. Not so easy to pack groceries into. Only 2 seats. And yes. It's a sports car. So repairs costs are higher then normal. But fun. Also the factory painted items inside the cab are peeling and scratch easy that require touch ups here and there.,1
Ask for instructions on all purchases unless you know how,1
Very good car...40MPG highway and 45MPG city!? Detroit could not beat that.,1
"Fits perfect, well worth the money",1
"I received a 2016 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab, It was not exactly as pictured though, The truck I received was red and was not the sport, but the Off-Road Package!  Great deal. There was tons of cardboard and bubble wrap though, and the blister pack was a pain, killed the blade on my sawz-all.
2016 Tacoma, a step up from the gen 2 Tacomas? Not sure yet.
They say the new Atkinson cycle engine has more horsepower but it comes on higher in the rev range, not exactly great for a truck, but it's not too bad, doesn't feel as powerful as the gen 2, maybe it's that much smoother.  Gas mileage so far has been about the same as my gen 2 Tacoma, which isn't too shabby. Entune touch screen 'media center' is a bit awkward to use.
On the bright side the ride is taught without being jarring, smooth on road or off.
Seats are Ok, maybe a touch less comfy then gen 2. There is a GoPro mount on the windshield, why?, don't know.
The key-less thing is annoying,  The truck is more than capable for my needs and is fun to drive.
Over-all I like the truck, will I like it as much as my old truck in a few years....we'll see.",1
"Road noise, poor defrosting on windshield.",1
"This car has everything I ever wanted in a car. It is compact, yet I still fit in it very well (I'm 6'1""). I have the GTI with a 1.8T so it is pretty peppy. It's not going to win any quarter mile races, but it's oodles of fun to take through some winding roads. Folding down the back seats unlocks a ton of storage space. I have moved TWICE in this car, so I know that it can hold a lot of stuff. It doesn't get the 5th star for two reasons, both of them because it's a VW. They are very well engineered, however sometimes they can be a bit over engineered. Replacement parts are pretty expensive, but it is a very reliable car so those aren't needed too often. The other issue is it has always had a few phantom electrical issues that no one has been able to diagnose. I am a auto tech student, so I see this as a troubleshooting challenge, but still it is quite annoying and for other people it might turn them off of VW altogether. So to summarize, it's fun, versatile, reliable, just maybe a bit too expensive to maintain for some. It's also 11 years old now, so buying one that is newer may be the better way to go, even though I don't like any of the newer body styles aside from the current one. I hope this review helps someone.",1
"Well built. Comfortable. Just keep an eye out for rust near the wheel wells. Interior is great but needs better cup holders. Rides like a cloud. Average gas mileage. Very few maintenance issues, in the few years I had mine all it needed was oil changes, one set of brake pads, a water pump ($290), a window switch ($15) and a tie rod ($100).",1
"Excellent ride, great towing capacity, great interior (real wood not plastic). Chose over BMW X5 due to extra interior room, better a/c, and the front seats are more secure. Cargo area is huge. Parking assist feature are great. Like the build quality.

Gas milage could be better and you have to use 91 octane or greater.",1
Fuel Economy is great,1
"Pretty good car but several things have stopped working since going over 120,000 miles. Power door locks quit. Seat belt will not unbuckle 50% of the time...I went to a Toyota dealership to see if they would fix it for free but they said no, that it would cost $400 to fix it. CD player no longer works. Headliner is sagging. Steering wheels squeals when turning. The car still runs and drives fine though.",1
"I got used, turbo convertible  vw... Leather package, the works... It has under 90,000 miles and I will have it A long time.. Love it.",1
Has treated me well with only general maintenance needs required. Hopefully it keeps on trucking for the years to come.,1
Our Camry LE has over 225k miles on it and keeps on kicking.  It has some engine oil leaks and is ready for new struts but is otherwise pretty much problem free.  The little four banger engine gets great mileage and has enough pick up to get on the highway without difficulty.  We see this model all over our area.  They last and last.  It's a really good car with good leg room in the back and a spacious trunk.,1
Great car for all weather but can be high maintenance. Treat them good and they will return The favor .,1
Good,1
"I have the All Terrain Model.  Plenty of power, love the red etching on the leather seats and interior. The stock 20"" rims go perfect with the truck.  Bose sound system sounds AWESOME.
My only complaint is the tranny sometimes slams into gear, but I'm told this is normal for this year.",1
I love my car but had to deducted a star because it does not have keyless trunk entry. Never even thought to check that on a 2012. My 2004 did so I just assumed. I have questioned trading due to this several times. Ultimately it's not enough of a reason not to keep it.,1
"The Yukon has been good. I bought it new and have had only a few problems. The air conditioner compressor has gone out. I have replaced the tail lights. Currently there is a small coolant leak which understand is common with the 350 engine. All in all not bad for 18 years. It rides very well, noise levels are good. I use it to tow my boat, power is very good.",1
A lot of truck for the money.  After 3 1/2 years not a single problem.  We have the 4.3 liter V6.,1
I like that it fit. I didn't like that it had a keyhole but it was an easy fix.,1
Great affordable and extremely reliable vehicle.,1
"Very Very good vehicle.  This is our 3rd Honda Odyssey.  1st was a 2003, then 2005, then this 2012.  All have been great.  Good gas mileage, usually 26-28 MPG during trips driving 75-80 MPH.",1
nice...,1
"I like the truck for the most part. I have owned a number of Chevy pickups over the years, a'93, '95, '01. I've owned 2-'04 and am currently driving one now. The biggest annoying issue is a clunking in the rears. There seems to be too much play or tolerance. When I pull away from a stop sign, red light or pull out anywhere, there is this clunking. There seems to be a lot of play somewhere, drivetrain, rears. Is this a common problem? I spoke with some dealers and other mechanics and they say that there needs to be a certain amount of tolerance. but with what I have, it seems like too much. I've driven Fords and Dodge's too and never had an issue.",1
We love our Tucson. Pros: great ride-power-looks-room-reliability  Cons: a little noise underneath when hitting rough spots in road (railroad tracks-pot holes) -also gas mileage not real good,1
"I like my van. It is a base model cargo van converted into a luxury passenger van. The van has had one problem that was major and I do not know if that was factory, or due to the custom conversion. The AC line to the back was installed improperly and due to vibration, it rubbed and wore away to the point where it burst and leaked all of the Freon out. I also had to replace the starter at 105,000 miles. All of the other issues I have had with it were due to the custom conversion, which can not be blamed on the manufacturer. The engine has great power and is very reliable. The suspension is good, and the tires have not had any unusual wear due to suspension issues. I would not be afraid to buy another.",1
"We need trucks like this today. Attempts to reintroduce ""compact"" trucks are a joke. My 2004 Ranger gives me utility, comfort, and value. I think that Ford could have utilized better technology to achieve better gas economy and structural durability, but they still had a winner with the Ranger.",1
Great daily driver with decent track performance when need to,1
"Car is really nice, it has a very roomy cabin so all people can comfortably sit. In regards to engine force I feel it's adequate for the car's weight but I do notice a bit of cabin noises (like cracks and squeaks), perhaps is just my car but I don't like that.",1
"Cheap, good and loyalty car, I love it.",1
"Love it. Very comfortable,  but...a few blind spots at front and back windshield.",1
A little smaller than what I'm use to,1
"This is a great car with a lot of quirks and gets expensive to maintain.  I've had mine for about 13 years, bought it new.  First the good stuff: it's really great in the snow.  I live in the mountains and it will go through anything with confidence.  It has a differential lock, which I've used in difficult situations to get out of trouble.  I don't put snow tires on, but that would make it even better.  Amazing traction.  It gets OK gas millage for its weight (almost 6k), about 18-20.  It's comfortable, the upholstery has held up well and easy on long drives.  Get good tires and the ride is OK and reasonably quiet.  Hard all terrain tires and it drives and sounds like a truck.  I've got over 130k and it still drives tight and fairly quiet, no engine trouble (knock on wood).

The bad: basic maintenance is always more expensive than similar cars.  Somewhere at 70k, the driveshaft bent and had to be replaced.  Really. Never had that on a modern car.  Pricey to fix.  A lot of the little stuff has needed replacement and is a pain to get to, the rear hatch gas lifts (3 hours to replace), the hood gas lifts (no big deal), the window switches (huge pain), the gas cover release (time consuming).  The center console lids don't really work right any more, the headlights got out of whack and don't quite sit in their over engineered slide, jury rigged that to keep in contact.  The paint has worn off the fan, heater, and radio controls.  Engine light goes on for no reason, reset a million times, comes back on within days.  Had an airbag sensor go out of wack, tire pressure monitor failed early on, never replaced.  Too many quirky sensors that give false readings.  A lot of plastic where there should be metal.

It's older now and still runs and looks good, so no strong complaints.  I wouldn't get another one, a lot of money for a quirky vehicle.  Still, has done its job over the years and still looks and feels like a luxury SUV.",1
"Nice van. Lots of pep, runs smooth. northern examples may have the usual rust on the rockers etc. known for needing headgaskets and lower intake man. gaskets replaced more often than some. comfortable to ride, lots of room for kids and stuff in the back with the rear seat folded up.

lots of nice features. good van.",1
Exceeded all my expectations!!!!,1
I have owned it since new in 2002. The 8.1L is a stump pulling torque dream. The crew cab held my 2 teenagers comfortably on many a road trip. The bed is a dream for hauling different configurations. The only gripe has been filling it up and the evap cannister involved there; sometimes stops the auto fueling too early.,1
Not fixed.,1
"Very good truck. Comfortable, not horrible on gas, plenty of power for towing as long as you don't have a huge trailer or camper.",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVE my pilot.  It has been such a reliable, safe, comfortable car. From the smooth ride, turning radius, to the spacious and comfortable interior, to the great sound system and the gas economy.  This is the perfect family and soccer mom/dad vehicle!",1
I love my LX.  I do suggest a K&N air intake for a little power gain and improvement in engine tone.  Great MPG.,1
"It's a JEEP, I enjoy both on the road and off. This one has a 4 cyl and I think it's a bit underpowered.",1
"Overall, we've had good luck with Nissans owning 4 over the last decade or so. Love most everything about our Quest, however, there are 2 things I hope they address in the coming years. 1. Road noise. It's loud inside. Granted, with the radio on, you don't notice it as much for such a big, solid vehicle, it should have significantly better soundproofing. 2. Brakes. They work but it seems like it could use larger brakes as it feels like we go through them more than any other vehicle we've had.",1
Excellent all-weather vehicle to have.,1
Seguridad y confianza  buen carro,1
"Ride is smooth if a bit ponderous with plenty of interior and trunk space. Took off one star since engine is noisier than expected under acceleration. Also, brakes are mushy and steering does not center well. Car has a nice package of options you just have to be patient and shop around for the best price. If you can test drive for a full weekend do so. I am happy with the car just not 5 star happy.",1
"I own 1999 nissan pathfinder and is awesome, comfortable, huge, with 215.000 miles don't have  any issue! Is amazing",1
"I purchased my 2016 Golf SE 2 years ago. I love almost everything about the car. This car has everything I needed and wanted for living in the city. It's quick, has good fuel economy, ample storage in the trunk, and the software is great (other than a few bugs here and there that seem to resolve themselves quickly). The 2016 SE is unique in that it comes with faux leather seats, sunroof, and upgraded fender speakers. Unfortunately, it doesn't have radars for lane assist and automatic breaking but I knew that going into my purchase.

Complaints: The occasional software bug means i sometimes have to restart my car in order for the entertainment system to fix a bug. This can be anything from not finding a device to the touch screen not responding to any inputs. Since this is very rare, I took off a half star. Second, there is a very, very sharp piece near the front of the gear shift knob. It sometimes cuts my hand when pulling things in and out of the console storage under the screen. I will need to sand this down or have VW replace this. I took off half a star for this because it's quite annoying that I'll need to invest time and/or money on something so silly that shouldn't be peeling off so early in the car's life.

TL;DR.. Buy this car!",1
Great truck,1
"I've had this Jeep since brand new. I love the color of commando green and get lots of compliments on it. Overall, the car has been a beast with little or no major issues whatsoever in nearly 5 years. It plows through snow, mud, water and whatever the elements can throw at it. One thing you have to get used to in owning a Wrangler is the noise level inside the cabin and the stiff ride due to the heavy-duty shocks. We love being able to remove the hard top or the T-Tops in the summer. We haven't removed the doors yet, but will look into it someday. The thing about owning a Jeep is that you are joining a community of people who also own Jeeps. Some of these people are very friendly and will give you the ""Jeep Wave"" as you meet in traffic, or in parking lots. However, there are other Jeep owners who are ridiculously opinionated on what they think a proper Jeep should look like. They have 7-inch lift kits, light bars, mud tires, winches, industrial jacks, fire extinguishers, stinger bumpers, modified fenders, and 52 other things they've added to their Jeeps at a very high cost. Having to suffer their disappointment in your stock Jeep they they refer to as a ""mall crawler"" can be exhausting. Still, we love our stock Jeep and it has gotten us through a lot of situations other cars couldn't go. The weak spots on this Jeep have been the rear tail lights. They seem to burn out at least once every other year. Also, the stock headlights aren't very bright and they get dirty very easily with road grime. Replacement LEDs are $500+ to make the switch. The windshield, because it's straight up, gets pelted with a lot of rocks from trucks ahead of you on the highway. We've already replaced 1 windshield and expect to be doing it again in another year or so. The center console release buttons are also very weak and tend to come off easily.",1
bad timing chains$$$ can not keep a rear wiper motor in mine. the timing chain is only a problem in the 3.6 engine.but still it is a good reliable car.i would buy another one.,1
Only regret is that we didn't get the V6..the 4 cylinder is under powered,1
"this is my wife's car she like how comfortable it is to drive in the city and on the highway. The 4 cylinder engine is ok, but it really needs the 6 cylinder turbo to get the acceleration you need for the highway. The like the third row seating, luckily we do not use it much, but its there if we need to. The push to start is get, being able to customize the the unlock feature to only the drivers do make her fill safe when alone. the hand free phone pairing was seamless and has yet failed to work.
I like amount of room for vehicle this size, it has been well worth buying.",1
The Porsche 944 is an excellent basic sports car.  It is light and nimble.  Some good ones can still be found for a reasonable price.  But buyer beware.  Many examples have been abused or poorly maintained.,1
Really good small suv. Not a lot of bells & whistles. The only drawback is HondaConnect (I don't have navigation) is awful!,1
"Was a good truck, traded it in on a Ram, The frame rusted out, and the cam roller bearing went out.",1
"My Volvo is a 940 turbo wagon.  It has approximately 300K miles.  The engine was replaced 16 years ago so it probably has >100K.  These cars are rugged, reliable and comfortable.  Of course it lacks lots of the creature comforts of  newer cars but that just makes it easier to maintain.  The red block engine is pretty simple and easy to service.",1
Product fit perfect on my VW passat 2004.,1
It is a solid and great running car.,1
love it to drive....but it needs something fixed all the time...,1
"Over the last 19 years I've had great experience with this truck even towing full horse trailers and small boats.  At 270,000 miles it still runs on the original motor, transmission, drive train axles and body.  It has just needed basic maintenance.  The only large bills I ever had were replacing two water pumps, two ac compressors, two alternators, the radiator, heater core and the fuel injectors at 200,000 miles.  Beyond that it has only needed new headlights once, tires, 3 ball joints, alignments and oil, transfer cases and transmission oil changes.  Everything works like new.  Even the Deep Forest Green finish is still beautiful.  The only thing I don't like is that the wheels wells behind the wheels and under the fender tend to catch and trap dirt, leading to a few visible small rust spots, but only where that pocket is formed. I'm sure later designs eliminated that pocket.  I probably over maintain it but it never stops and always starts. Mileage is about 13/19 mpg.  Oil use is now at 1 quart per 1,500 miles, but I changed the PCV valve to a fixed orifice design that helped a lot.  Oil pressure is still at 20 psi hot idle and 45 on the road.",1
"200,000 and drives like new. It's been a great vehicle for us",1
"At 69,000 miles my Xterra feels tight. No rattles or squeeks. S-model does""nt have the killer srereo of the SE model but still sounds good. Lots of muscle under the hood, at 16 mpg avg. I installed a tow hitch the day after i bought it and it tows very well. Lots of cargo space and accessory options.",1
My 2013 F150 STX is one of the best cars I ever had,1
"5.7L V8 soft top convertible.

CONs:
Leaks when it rains. Horrible blind spots. Both window motors died. Blew out the stock speakers with the stock Monsoon 500 watt stereo. Horrible gas mileage.

PROs:
Still fun to drive. Almost impossible to tip even driving fast around sharp corners.

Only put 60,000 miles on it in 15 years.",1
Fit car right,1
"My Honda Odyssey has over 190,000 miles on it, and I still love it.  It is so roomy, comfortable, and plenty powerful.  I can load up 7 kids and carpool them, or I can haul furniture.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I have had some unusually annoying suspension and bracket problems beginning early in my ownership (was purchased new), and every once in a while another mounting bracket of some sort seems to go bad.  Granted I have driven many miles, but this started soon after I purchased it.",1
"I have owned my Nitro SXT for 6 years.  I have had only one repair, a leak in the a/c system that took several attempts to locate.  Otherwise, reliability has been excellent.

When I first bought it, I glowed when one friend asked me, ""Is that a new mini-Hummer?""  (This was before the demise of Hummer)  I offered to carpool with a coworker, and she said, ""Oh, yes, let's take your new Land Rover.""  Many compliments on the appearance (it is the loaded SXT, with running boards, 4.0 litre engine, wide wheels).

The fold down passenger seat is a big plus for hauling long items.  You can literally store an item from the dashboard to the back of the hatch, almost 8 feet.

The MyGig GPS and audio system are FANTASTIC.  One of the best GPS systems ever, passengers have said it is so much simpler to operate than their own.  The audio system is so powerful (speakers literally everywhere, and some big ones) they can make the side mirrors on the doors vibrate.  The hard disc drive not only stores audio, but a photo library.  One downside: the disc drive will play DVDs, but only when the car is not in motion.  I'm not sure what Dodge was thinking: pull over to the side of the road and watch a movie?  Passengers are unable to watch a DVD while the vehicle is in motion.

Only negatives are the interior trim.  Lots of hard plastic.  For the top of the line model, it would have been nice to have some softer material on the console and doors.  And this SXT 4x4 model comes with sport tuned suspension, which makes this SUV very stable on sharp turns but the stiffened suspension is a bit rough on bad roads.",1
"200k and drives like new. Outside of the usual maintenance like fluids, brakes and shocks, I have replaced the upper catalytic converter and I am about to fix the a/c. Those two things are the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. I have come to expect nothing but excellence from Toyota and I was surprised by the failures in those two systems. I will continue to buy Toyota vehicles but probably won't have to for another 300k.",1
"Had this truck 10 years.  Only money spent is on scheduled, routine items. Now have 150,000 miles. The only bad thing is Ford doesn't make the Ranger anymore.",1
"I rate the 2000 E430 Mercedes a 4+. Very few vehicles would earn a 5 rating because there are very few 5's or ""perfect"" cars.  That said, it is a  good combination of elements wanted in a vehicle when fuel economy is NOT the most important requirement. It has the usual long list of luxury features MB is known for, better than average power with a 4.3 liter V8 that can return between 22-24 mpg on the highway. It has not required more than normal service or repairs with more than 200,000 miles on the odometer.",1
Good truck for the every day and lite construction. Truck has 240k miles and still runs strong with the 3.0L v6. Just wish it got better mpg. Right around 20 mpg  highway.,1
Does everything well but if you are big into feeling the road and drive for excitment this is not for you.  Great all around car for the family.  Just could not give it 5 stars because of the CVT transmission robing the fun of driving.,1
I have this car since new. I am still driving it although the mileage is above 200k. I love this car. There were no major issues except routine maintenance in all these years.,1
"I drove a Durango Limited 6 cylinder AWD as a rental for 3 days. I was impressed by the vehicle. Despite not having the Hemi, I thought it had strong acceleration. The 8 spd transmission was super smooth. Averaged btw 23 and 25 mpg in mostly highway driving.  Motor shut off feature was noticeable at every stoplight but not intrusive.
Electronics interface was mostly intuitive and enjoyable. Switching between radio and climate often was a little annoying. Screen also somewhat far from driver. I'm 6'2"" and it still seemed like a stretch. Max a/c seemed to mean 60 degrees which was not an interpretation I'd seen before. Controlling rear climate also a chore to access. I have young kids. Would probably not be an issue with adults or older kids in the back that could control it themselves.  Chrome around many things created nasty glare at times. Can't believe automakers don't eliminate interior chrome.

Front seats were comfortable and provided good driving position. I checked out the 3rd row and it seemed decent. Would be fine for kids.

Good space behind 3rd row and recessed area under cover was actual useable space. Not minivan esque but certainly better than GM Tahoe, Yukon, etc space which accommodates essentially newspapers. Push button tailgate worked well.

Overall, Durango was pleasure to drive and one I'd consider if shopping for 3 row SUV.  Looks tougher than most. :)",1
Rides like a car not a truck. Perfect height to slide in and out of the seats.  My wife and I are very happy with it. The Dilemma with this vehicle is the electronics lights from the cluster can come on traction control on off you can take it to a dealer and you'll get the same response couple months later looking for a good ride this is it looking for something to put money into LOL this is it,1
Yes the 6.0 has some problems. But by 2006 they had fixed most of them..... I personally like the truck!,1
1000 miles in and loving everything about it.,1
"Beautiful design. Great handling. Smooth 2-litre six with lots of torque. All the problems of an old British car. Hot in the cockpit unless you have a sunroof. Not a hot rod (something like 80 or 90 horsepower, but only weighs about a ton), noisy transmission (so overdrive is a plus). Despite low production numbers, most parts are available due to shared parts with other Triumph automobiles. You need a good set of tools, a workshop manual or two, and some spare time (or lots of cash and an elderly reliable mechanic), but this car can be a joy.",1
"The car is wonderful, nav/power seat/touch screen/auto headlights/keyless start and entry/ remote start and automatic climate control to name a few features.  Only negative I have is wishing it had a little more power/acceleration.  The gas mileage makes up for that though been averaging over 30 mpg on a vehicle of this size.",1
love the auto wipers heated steering wheel and the smoth ride,1
"We had this car for 12 years.  For a 12 year old car, it did well.  At the end, we ended up replacing too many things from the engine area and got rid of it when the AC failed.  My wife was not overly gentile with this car and we definitely got our money's worth out of it.  If I had to do it over again, I would have bought a Toyota...for the hopes of having less late in life repair work.",1
"aside from electrical issues (doors, trunk, etc) this car is great. Can take a beating",1
I just bought this car. It ran very bad at the time. i only paid $900 for it. With some TLC and a  tune up car now runs great.  The paint sucks oxidized! 21 yrs old,1
"This is a great car. Tight front end, comfortable seats, good nav. infotainment system, and good acceleration with 6 cylinder engine. When I first purchased this new Jeep it had a transmission problem. After 2-3 return dealer visits the problem was fixed and the car is fine now. I also like the ability to lay down back seats and the front passenger seat to carry 8' lumber or long items.",1
"Just bought new shocks for my 97 Grand Cherokee limited, hopefully this upgrade will stop my jeep from haveing a death wobble at speeds above 55-60 mph.",1
"Altogether a very good vehicle. The only issue I've had was a speed sensor went out causing the speedometer to work irradically. My Durango is just about to roll over 200,000 miles, but still runs extremely strong. I Love my Durango!!",1
"I have had the car for almost 6 months and put over8,200 miles. Here is what I like and dislike:

Likes:
-Looks. Bought the ""gray"" which actually looks more like charcoal black.
-Decent backseat room. Perfect for my teen kids.
-Fuel Economy. Averaging about 35 MPG in mixed city/highway. I like in the suburbs but still deal with lights. Its not stop & go but its not true highway either.
-Lots of standard features for the iSport. Rear view camera, Bluetooth, voice commands, text reads (although it sometimes doesn't work, I think EMOJIs give it issues).
-Acceleration. Its quick but not if you have the AC on.
-Braking. Maybe because the brakes are brand new but it stops on a dime.
-Money factor on leasing. *This is key if you are considering leasing. I researched a lot on this but Mazda offers competitive money factors. It is cheaper for me to lease the Mazda3 than say a Kia Soul although the Soul is cheaper.*
-Warranty: Powertrain - 5 yr/60k miles plus 3 yr/36k miles roadside assistance (although I have AAA).
-Reliability. Consumer Reports has rated Mazda as one of the most reliable brands.

Dislikes:
-Road noise. Not sure if it is the tires but the road noise is the worst and loudest. I thought my old 2013 Civic had a lot of road noise but this Mazda3 is load!
-Seats a little uncomfortable.
-Black interior. Looks nice but in the summer, black dashboard and black seats will make the car an oven.
-In the second week of ownership, I made a wide right turn and heard a loud pop underneath the car. Then I started hearing metal hitting each other after hitting bumps. Took it to the dealer. They said everything was fine but did confirm the noise. After 3 hours, they said they needed to contact Mazda (this was on Saturday). Noise went away by Monday. Not sure if they fixed it unknowingly. Gone for now. However once in a while when it hits a bump a certain way, it makes a hollow thump sound.

I was really expecting perfection but got slightly less. Let's see how it handles the next 6 months.  Would still recommend it.",1
"I've owned my Veracruz LTD since 2007 and I have 185,000 miles on it. When the Veracruz was introduced, it was ahead of all other SUV in its class and price point, for styling, handling, people and cargo capacity, fuel economy and quality of performance and road handling. My Veracruz has not lost its value or effectiveness - even after 185,000 miles. I'd buy another if they still made this model. In fact Hyundai, if you read this review, I think you have an opportunity to develop a luxury SUV to compete with some of the other market leaders. A luxury SUV is a gap today in Hyundai's product line, so a Genesis like SUV class/model is due.",1
What's not to love? It's a big block with a 5 speed. Pulls whatever I need it to and it's built like a tank. It's easy to work on when it does need something.,1
"I bought and drove a silver B5.5 VW Passat W8 for 4 years. The car has an understated styling and (for the time) quick engine, bi xenon headlights, all wheel drive, heated leather seats, and decent Boss stereo system.

The handling - car hugged the road in dry pavement, pulled a jeep out if mud while in mud, and ice/snow was never a concern. The suspension is overall soft.

Styling - understated on the outside. Most people would not even notice the 4.0 W8 badge. The inside is simular to the lower models, but will every option checked. Real wood, real leather, and soft touch materials everywhere. The only downside is this is so understated that some people are disappointed that it is not distinguish enough from the lower models.

Engine - this has a W8 engine (imagine two v4 on a common crankshaft ) that us 4.0 litters. It makes roughly 270 Hp and 280 torque. The max torque starts around 2500 rpm and holds to redline. I has the 5 speed auto in manual mode. The shifts were a little slow, but you can time it right for it not to matter as much. In the auto mode, it shifts like most vw/audi's at the time.

Other - the bi xenon light were great for the time, but wish they went further (but is very bright in its light range). The stereo is decent, Boss with a tape/cd player (optional cd changer which I used). Sunroof worked well. Quad exhaust does sound great.

The bad stuff - repairs are expensive. This may not be obvious to some people. This is an expensive 8 cyc car German car, and it is expected  to maintained and repaired like so. It does share some common parts, but not the expensive stuff.

Crappy gas mileage if you are not used to this segment. This should be expected. It is a awd car, with a W8 and weighs over 4000 lbs. It's actual mpg is pretty good for its class 16/23 (I could get 28ish on longer trips).

Overall - Glad I used to own this car, great handeling, power delivery, and never got stuck, even off road. But it was getting old (12 years at the time) and needed some repairs that I felt was better off spending on a new car.",1
"111k miles so far, going good.",1
"I've had this car for ten years now.  It's been a blast to drive and still brings a smile to my face when I stomp the gas pedal.  It's unbelievably fast and very solid.  The E platform is very well built.  The car isn't perfect and has a couple of things to consider before buying.  You'll read about gas tank issues, Airmatic failures, SBC brake issues, etc.  Those are all real concerns.  Overall, the care has been very reliable.  When things to decide to go wrong, it gets expensive very fast.  It's important to have a great set of tools and utilize forums and youtube.  If you don't, the dealership for a car this age is very, very expensive.  As a comparison, I just completed several repairs that would've run close to $4,500 at the dealership.  I did them all myself for under $1,500, using mainly Mercedes Benz original parts or OEM Mfg. parts by Bosch.  Remember, these cars are relatively cheap for what you get, but you are repairing a car that originally pushed $85k over 14 years ago.",1
It's a good little winter beater but it's ugly with little to no creature comforts,1
Great truck runs perfect for it being older made to last only thing is I don't like the look so much much,1
"A great luxuriant beast of a vehicle. A previous owner had applied after-market ""Size Matters"" lettering--in the same raised-metal font as the factory ""Excursion"" lettering--and to be sure, it is large. The same owner had also installed 20-inch wheels in place of the 16-inch stock wheels, so the Ford sits up even higher than it normally would. With the automatic and 6.0 diesel, the Excursion is slow to accelerate and a little sluggish in handling especially as compared with our '06 Dodge 3500 with the HO 5.9L diesel and the 6-speed stick; it also gets nowhere near the Dodge's fuel economy.
On the plus side, it's a wonderfully comfortable ride and great for a long trip on the freeway--once it GETS to freeway speeds, it sails along smoothly. You can pile a lot of stuff in it, too.",1
It's a mess of a car to fix when not maintained properly but get it up to date with all its maintenance you definitely won't regret it! This is one of the last DIY cars before BMW started throwing all that electronic crap in the newer cars.,1
"I love this jeep but there are some minor stuff  that you need to buy, mostly the issue with the break lights going out",1
takes a beating.,1
Nice fuel mileage nice ride,1
"Great car for what it is. Gets me from point A to B whenever I need it. Used to be our travel car untill we got a 2015 vehicle. Still runs great though, I drive it every day.",1
I had few problems when first got the car had smoke from exhust. An went Through Oil it was just a pcv value was replaced an runs nice now I have a driven manual transmission all my adult life so was a big change,1
Basically it is good for us!!,1
"Love the Car gets many looks , Have it good and bad. But all around its a very nice car to own .....Just it Winter the AWD is better then the rear wheel drive. and you you look for a bit of speed don't get the 2.7l it moves along fine but at a stand still its not good the 3.5 is a better then for a lot more speed go with the 5.7l",1
It's a great car that has great gas mileage and low maintenance cost.  I enjoy driving it and can't wait to buy another one in the future.,1
"Very raw, impractical, and not really suitable for daily driving. But every time I want to sell it, I go for a drive and the thought of selling it goes out the window. Massive grip and one of a kind feel thru the steering wheel no other car can replicate.",1
"loved my Silverado Crew cab, had the best ride, motor was kind of weak and it burned oil. Not many issues really.",1
"tight chassis, good handling , very good power from the inline 6 motor , trans shifts crisply.  tight engine compartment , difficult to work on .parts can be expensive if you don't know where to get them . poor seats,not supportive enough , and hard padding . interior trim starting to peel off.",1
Has plenty of rear seating/stowage room. Ecoboost 3.5 moves super crew like a car. Brake recall took weeks though.  The dealership failed to keep tire pressure correct when doing their tire rotations and oil changes. Tires wore out on edges way TOO soon.,1
Mine is an '07 company vehicle I bought from a past employer.  It is an all around good truck even after ten years.  My new company vehicle is a '16 chevy p/u and I think the Ford is hands down still the better vehicle.,1
"Caution, as the timimg components on the front of the engine aren't good. They need very good oil.",1
"Overall, this car is VERY reliable. The only thing I have had to do to my car in the 11 years I have owned it is change the tire on multiple occasions. I was young when I bought it and bought the ""performance"" version of the car and have low profile tires. If you can avoid this, do so at all costs, as they are a pain in the butt! I foresee keeping/ driving this car for years to come.",1
Small tight truck  I had the extended cab and just loved it.,1
The truck is solid and rides nice does have some rust issues but most trucks do.,1
Nice car made with quality materials. Very comfortable and fuel efficient. Would be excellent if it was RWD.,1
My Jeep has been a fantastic choice. I transitioned from a Land Rover Discovery (which I loved and drove into the ground) so I didn't expect to enjoy my Wrangler as much as I have... I have used it for extensive highway driving and off-road... it has exceeded my expectations.,1
"5.3L LM7 Z71 Crew Cab. Rides pretty smooth, comfy, roomy for long drives. Roomy backseat. Plenty of power for those mountain grades. I don't tow. I have 220K miles on it.",1
love it,1
"Great truck after I had to fix all the common defects, cam phasers, timing chain and guides and other things. . It's fourteen years old and still rides as new. I love my truck.",1
Extremely reliable. Easy to work on. Very well engineered,1
Good reliable vehicle... it's a Honda... but not 5 stars because of cost when having to replace parts and doing service.,1
"I love my car, and having a convertible. It's so nice during summer, and I can rely on my car!",1
"They are generally good cars, that drive/handle well, but there are several items which fail repeatedly that will make you wonder why BMW didn't correct them. As the cars get older, it is very common for door handles to break in a cold climate when the temperatures drop below freezing and the door ""sticks"". Ther door handle carrier is made of cheap metal and it has broken on multiple times on multiple doors. It is also very common to have window regulators break on these cars. They use cheap plastic pulleys in the design and they break dislodging the aircraft cable that raises/lowers the window. For a more serious issue, in cold climates, moisture in the cyclone valve can freeze causing oil from the sump to be sucked into the engine, which will blow the valve cover gasket and spread oil throughout the hoses leading to the cyclone valve. This can and potentially hydro-lock the engine, ruining the engine. BMW first came out with a cold climate kit that adds insulation to the hoses/valve, but they didn't proactively replace the parts, or fix the issue for free when it happened. This kit was installed in my car, and my daughters 2002 X5 when the same thing happened to her. That fix failed again on my car and they charged me for a heated intake manifold (the real fix) and the issue has not happened again. Both times BMW indicated the car was out of warranty and charged and arm and a leg for the fixes they knew were failing on many of their engines in cold climates. Note the chance of this happening goes up when you drive short trips because any moisture in the engine may not be burned off and it has to be really cold (below zero). The other thing that will fail on these cars is the oil filter housing gasket. It sounds easy to fix, but it is a lot of work to replace the gasket.",1
"The car performs very well, however spare parts are expensive and hard to find.",1
"Have owned a 2002 9-3 Convertible Saab for a while now.  Great little car with a lot of spunk.  The turbo makes that 4 cylinder engine really perform. The only complaint I have about it is that there is no feature to unlock the doors electronically from inside the cabin of the vehicle.  The ride is smooth and even for a convertible it is relatively quite in the cabin with the top up.  Maintenance can be expensive, but the parts are still available and the after market parts are just as good as OEM part. We only have 39,000 miles on this car and are the second owners.",1
Love my car. I have a 2012 charger SE I got it around 70k and now its almost at 130k. Its been a great car since I've had it the only maintenance I've had to do was oil changes and tires changes. I did have a problem with the alternator before but there was a recall that fixed this issue. Love the looks and love the interior. Makes it feel like its much more luxurious and expensive than it actually was. Only thing that I have to complain about was the body is very fragile. I live in LA land of pot holes and after hitting one pot hole the car front bumper cracked and the crack spread quickly. I had to replace it eventually. That and the alternator were my only complaints.  Other than that love my car,1
"Second Taurus , 1st was an '86 went 260k and gave it away ( under its own power )
2nd an '02 , 100k on the clock . the '86 was best in class piece by peace . the '02 not all the pieces , but still very good.",1
Very good truck. Reliable and lots of power.,1
"I have 225,000 miles on mine.  Little problems and a new transmission, yes.  But zero car payments run fine, I will take everyday.  Don't buy if you want perfect but any good mechanic can help you if you need it.  OH still running with the original set of brake pads.",1
"Power, and gas mileage",1
"It is my daughter's car,, and she loves it, drives it a lot and other than leaking a little oil it has been fine.",1
"As an owner of two e39's i can say they are built solid only their only vulnerability is their cooling system, but other than that it is an amazing car. The manual trans is the way to go. I would give this car a 4.5 stars.",1
"Purchased a year ago.  Taken one trip of 1100 miles and the remainder has been within 50 miles of home.  No problems.  Enjoy the crew cab and the options available .  I am 6' 2"" and 70 years old...easy to get in and out.",1
"I can rate my car on amazon? That's cool I guess... favorite features are the heated steering wheel and the overall quality and luxury of the vehicle, period.",1
"I HAVE A FUEL ECONOMY, BLACK 2016 MAZDA3 I 4 DOOR SPORT -SDN. SKYACTIV 2.0L, 4-CYL, 6SPD AUTO TRANS,155 HP.. My third BLACK Mazda3. 1st 2010, 2nd 2015. I loved my 2010, It was loaded. Anyway my 2016 has a few new really cool features, like a backup cam, blind spot sensors, their are sensors all around the car. It's an amazing car. I have nothing bad to say about my Mazda. Mazda vehicles have been in my family for years.  So why 4.5 stars? only because I'd be 100% happier if I could have a few changes that my 2010 had like; sunroof, leather interior, push button keyless entry on the door handel. Not to mention I'd like a RED Mazda but I feel like it's fine.. My windows are tinted dark, and I'll get some nice rims. And the car will look sick.. ",1
It is a nice car for small family. It is served us well.,1
"I am not a car guy, but this thing gets the job done. Rides great, features are okay and the space is great too.

The only reason I rate it 4/5 is because the media package is borderline terrible.
-Toyota's Entune Software App is some of the worst design I have ever experienced and regularly doesn't function when your smart device is in the vehicle. Additionally, the speaker system in the car is not very loud, at times I have turn the volume way up to get a decent amount of sound.
-The navigation system is not that great either, and will not pick the fastest route, and until recently couldn't add specifics like avoiding tolls.
-If the car is moving, no one can adjust maps or change specific stations on media apps; the car can detect there's a second person not wearing a seat belt, but it can't use that info to unlock the screen while driving so my passenger can choose stuff for me? Seems like poor design.

Aside from the media package being terrible, the car functions great, rides smooth, and has had zero mechanical issues since I've owned it. Lots of small features have really made life pleasant owning a Camry.

-Wireless Charger
-Powered Adjustments for Driver's Seat
-Fine tuning displays
-Self explanatory warnings
-Lots of storage space",1
"V6 Awd sxt - great car, commute was about 100 miles a day so it's range with the large fuel tank helped me avoid constant fuel stops. Awd will get you out of slippery spots but it's not 4x4 or as strong as a subie in this area. 4 stars cause I wanted a few more features and once you have 300hp you want more. However I'm now driving a loaded 2017 charger with the same engine but all the features and am even more happy.",1
Fit my truck perfect. Very well made.,1
"I've had all the exact same issues with my 99.5 jetta as the other poster.

Also replaced cup holders 5 years ago, three of the four power window assemblies, I'm ignoring the broken glove box because it shuts correctly. Just replaced the coil pack (where the ignition cables lead to) with one off of amazon that worked out great.  I'm actually burning through a quart every 500 so consider yourself lucky I guess :)

Biggest work thus far has been a transmission rebuild at 130,000. Not cheap.

Overall love that it handles better than a honda, and for a 99, it's often mistaken for a much newer car (amazon's picture is of the older body 99, not the 99.5-04 jetta body style). The paint job has held up quite nicely too.",1
"Its an excelent car for offroading, it can be modified easily to improve the performance. The only reason I don't give the 5 stars is because in the case you can choose between a yj and a tj, go for the coil springs tj.",1
Great service. Will use again,1
"91,000 miles on it. V-8 Quadcab Dakota.  Normal service although the front suspension has been replaced with upgraded parts. Used for light towing (4000# boat and trlr) locally to the ramps.  Fuel economy about what would be expected.  All systems and electronics working satisfactorily and no major problems.  List price of this vehicle was $31K+ in 2006 with all options and matching bed cap.  Been a good vehicle and don't expect to replace it in the near future as long as it provides good service",1
"Good car
Every thing ok at the moment",1
Great truck---note just a truck---not a luxury vehicle . I like a truck to use like a valued tool and this one just fits .,1
I've this car for 10 years. It has 237 thousand miles and it's still going strong. Great gas mileage. The only thing I don't like is not roomy inside enough. Other than that I will have this car probably till the day it dies,1
It's a good truck all and all but I believe all trucks should be rust treated by the factory. To many beautiful trucks and cars fall apart from the rust up north.,1
"This was a very good car.  I had very few problems with it and those were just normal, replacing battery, etc.  I had it for 10 years and would still be driving it if it wasn't totaled by another driver.",1
"The car/suv is awesome, but at this age of the car there will be numerous wear and tear repairs all of which are not really a surprise. The one thing to watch out for any Subaru is that it uses a interference engine....meaning if the piston and valves share the same space but not at the same time. Since timing is crucial to prevent the pistons and valves from colliding the timing chain should be replaced between 100,000 and 120,000 miles. Otherwise the car is fun to drive and dependable assuming good maintenance.",1
"Love this truck! Mine is a dually and it had minor issues, but nothing I couldn't fix or replace! All my parts are cheaper here on Amazon",1
its just a nice old used xlt ext. cab 4x4 that looks and runs good  I want to keep it runing good @ looking good  thank you sam.,1
"My car is 20 years old. This is the car I enjoyed most, after having an Acura, and a Mercedes before it.
It is a gas guzzler giving me 13-15 miles/gallon.
It is very spacious silent and comfortable, and since I don't use it much after retirement, the gas consumption does not bother me.
Maintenance is very reasonable.",1
Great car with few problems. Took off one star for its slightly rough ride.,1
-one star is because the paint sucks! Clear coat peels off. Honda is a nice looking car and very reliable. Cars from different companies and same year don't have that problem. I live in Va. Not in the desert. It's not very sunny and hot year round,1
"I liked the 2005 so much that I traded it in for a 2011. It's comfortable, handles well, and good in the snow. 4 cyclinder performance is excellent, and reallysaves on gas compared to my old V6 model.

What I don't like:
Sync is just awful, plagued with poor voice recognition and unfriendly to use. Replaced it with an aftermarket receiver.

Road noise is very high, but not uncommon for an Escape.

The crossbars are slanted, making it impossible to lay anything flat on top of the car. I resolved this by replacing with Mazda Tribute crossbars.

AC Blower fan circuit board needs to be replaced every few years because it get exposed to moisture, clearly a design flaw.

I had to drill tie down mounts into the chassis. This was a standard feature in earlier models, almost every SUV should have a basic hole to put rope thru to tie down heavy objects.

The interior is mostly cheap plastic.",1
it's a great van. just needs more head room if your tall.,1
"Good looking body style, rides and handles nicely. Interior comfort is great with the leather package, but the driver controls are a bit lacking. Poorly designed door handles being made of plastic and having a tendency of braking off, making the car inaccessible except through another door. Poor design of door locks that they fail within 3-4 years, despite numerous complaints by other Buick owner's there are no recalls or repair assistance. Lock repair will set you back nearly $1,000 parts and labor. Having owned a 1998 Cadillac Seville and now 10 years later a 2008 Buick, well the Buick despite being newer, lacked more features that I expected. Buick gets the eye appeal, but lacks in every other department especially the customer service and quality. My next buy will never be a Buick again.",1
"I have had this car for 7 years now an been happy with it overall. I have 108,000 miles on it and haven't really had any major problems except for a transmission cooler issue which was fixed by the dealer due to an extended warranty on it as a know issue. The trunk is really large for a vehicle of it's size. The fuel economy is pretty average to good. Parts are readily available and pretty cheap and the car is easy to work on for the most part. It is a little bit of a pain to have to remove the intake manifold to change the spark plugs and the cabin filter is in a silly place behind the accelerator pedal. The finishes inside it are not top of the line but for what I paid for it, it was nice enough. Bottom line this car is a great value for an everyday car and pretty big in terms of cabin size and trunk size for it's class. It's not the nicest thing out there but it gets the job done.",1
"Great little car 200,000 miles!",1
I enjoy my Kia soul. It is a great car to drive around the city. I don't like taking it on road trips because the gas gets eaten up quickly on the freeway. And she's not that fast or can handle really high speeds.  I average 24 miles to the gallon & wish it were more.,1
"Good reliable vehicle with a powerful V6 for the year it was produced. Gets pretty good gas mileage for a V6, and while it has some common issues most are minor.",1
Love it but wish it had a navigation and back up camera.,1
"2.3L 4cyl auto 2WD

+ LOVE the idea of high plastic molding / trim around the doors. Less worry about rust and dents!
+ Very reliable in the snow and ice, even without 4WD. Have been able to drive through deep snow on hills while others have gotten stuck.
+ High ground clearance; Since I do a lot of city driving, it really helps to not bottom-out on every curb or sidewalk.
+ Roomier interior than you'd think, especially the cargo area.
+ Sporty appearance in and out, without being flashy.
+ Replacement parts are plentiful to find and therefore not too expensive, thanks to 'twin' models Escape and Mariner

- Fuel economy: despite upkeep and conscientious driving, I routinely get just 18-19 MPG. Granted I do mostly city driving, but this is less then the EPA estimates
- Rear seats can be a bit of a hassle to fold: push front seat forward, remove headrest, pull cushion from front, push cushion from rear, pull seatback  ... in that order. Not a big deal, but something to consider if you frequently switch between 4/5 passengers and large cargo.

Overall: Definitely recommended. Fits a wide range of uses. Would give 4 1/2 stars if possible, or 5 stars if MPG was a bit better.",1
170k miles and still going,1
Great truck! The 6.2L gas fired engine has poor fuel milage.  12.4 mph town without towing the 5th wheel.,1
"Its a great vehicle. It has a lot of little things that seem to break. And when they do, it looks like its going to be an expensive repair, but it ends up being some little tiny part.  Its best to research and try to fix it yourself first before taking to a mechanic.  Its an older vehicle, so everyone has all sorts of repair information on them, and parts can be really cheap on Amazon.  Very smooth ride for a 4X4 and its very quiet inside! But it really burns a lot of gas!  The 4.0 engine has been around for a million years. Its older technology, so its limited how much you can pull out of it. Same engine I had in my 78 Grand Wagoneer I had 30 years ago.

Now the kids are out of the house, I get my Jeep!",1
"This thing has 184,000 miles and runs good.  4.2 liter V6 5 speed manual transmission.  No air conditioning and power nothing.  Reliable and not too bad on gas.",1
25 years old still going strong. Built to last.,1
"I love this truck but it has two problems. One, when you step on the fuel pedal, the engine hesitates before responding. the the MPG is not what I'd hope for. Although, I will soon test that thought. I mostly drive locally now but come first of next year, I will be pulling my RV more often and hope to gain mileage.
Other then that I love this truck. I did have one other problem, I had to change out the brakes and calipers at 36,000 miles. I believe this we due to my fifth Wheel trailer weighing in at 17,500 lbs and the trailer brakes not working correctly. I made one trip[from from NE Indian to Panama City, Fl. and to small trips to Elkhart, In. with the truck doing all the stopping. At least I hope that was the problem.",1
Expected better gas mileage.,1
its good for a used,1
"I have owned my 1999 Chevy Suburban for over a year now. It has the 6.5 litre diesel engine with 135,000 miles now. It was well taken care of by the the original owner I purchased it from.

I use the truck to pull trailers, and haul all types of cargo to our mountain home. It works perfectly with plenty of power. I wish Chevrolet would offer a diesel option in the Suburban again!",1
"Bought used in '11 with 46k miles, an ex rental. Main reason purchased was it had the Adventure Pkg with frt/rear lockers and 4:1 transfer case. It is also the year they switched to a cast iron front axle with bigger CVs, unlike the aluminum unit in the '06-'08 models. 120k miles still solid, zero rattles. Problems under warranty were broken driver and center a/c vents, inoperative power seat lumbar adjuster, leaking rear axle seal. Problems after warranty were cracked radiator, grinding noise from starter (still worked), and BCM/EBCM computers went out, all after 100k mile mark. I fixed the radiator/starter myself but computer issues were expensive as a shop had to tackle that. Two recalls easily fixed: hood louver needed to be glued down and HVAC wiring connector needed replacing. Love the overall capability it has. This truck sees trail-duty. It is not babied and I have yet to break it while wheeling. Hate the gas-guzzling, weakling 3.7L motor and blindspots, and the lousy lack of aftermarket accessories compared to other 4x4s, but I knew that buying it. Could use a little more storage nooks inside as the door pockets are ridiculously narrow. Also wish the back seat folded flat instead of slanted forward. Overall quality and durability has been very good with stuff like the paint, dash, seats, and headliner still looking new and the drivetrain still running smooth. And I love the look of Jeepers when they see it can hang with their Fiat/Chrysler Heeps in the rough stuff.",1
"I own a GT 40th anniversary edition, one of the most comfortable cars I've ever owned, very nimble, and fun to drive, with a large after market support that may come close to rivaling jeep.",1
I have had my truck for 5 years and still love it,1
So pleased with the prices and delivery.. I'll keep on  shopping!,1
"Okay, one thing... the crew cabs are still made in Mexico, however I personally don't think that has any negative impact on the vehicles quality. Its by far the most stylish, luxurious, but still butt kicking truck in its class. The transmission takes getting used to, but Ive read its been programmed a certain way to boost fuel efficiency which is fine with me. This is my second Sierra, probably not my last!",1
"This is our second Enclave and we love it.  A very comfortable car to drive and ride in. We will stick with the Buick over the GMC because of a much quieter ride, the road noise is barely noticeable.",1
I have owned this truck for 8 years. I bought it with 40K miles on it and it currently has 205K on it. This truck has been the most reliable car I have ever had. I want a new truck but it is hard to let go of a truck that almost never breaks down on it.,1
"great truck, has well over 200000 miles on it. runs great, and will pull anything",1
"I've had four 2nd generation rams. Dodge RAM will always be my first choice. The dashboard and the heater cores have been bad in every single truck. Other than that, you can't go wrong!",1
"My wife and I bought this convertible to use as a daily driver for me and a vacation roadster for both of us. We previously owned a 95 Camaro convertible for the same purpose, but we much prefer the 01. The interior of the 01 has a better layout and the 3.8 v6 engine is far superior to the 3.4 v6 that was in the 95. it has plenty of power but still gets good gas mileage (28 to 30 highway). All kinds of people stop me all the time and tell me how much they love the look of the car. Not much of a back seat but perfect for the Grandkids! I did add a bluetooth radio and a flowmaster muffler. (Have to have the right sound!)",1
"Quiet, comfortable ride.",1
"over 500,000 miles on it , awesome motor has timing gears ,not a chain or belt. has auto trans, air and power steering. It is not a high speed vehicle,but runs no matter what. Very relaxing to drive. I wish ford still built this motor .",1
One of the best trucks that I have ever owned  The only thing the clear coat on the paint is starting to peel back,1
"230,000 miles and runs fine. No major repairs other than the timing belt.",1
Love this car so much .  Handles great and rides comfortably .  Now I'm looking for a convertible !,1
SC is Great!!!!,1
"I purchased my Saab 5 monthd ago. It has 104,000 miles, 5 speed manual and it's the SE version. So far it has been a reliable car, very strong motor with 205 HP, very comfortable and nice; only problem is windows; two of them broked, they don't work. It suppose the window rollers are broken, actually I purchased new ones and I will install them on this days, despite that, it's a great car for $1,300.00 dollars.",1
Best truck ever purchased!,1
"This a 2012 Mercedes-Benz C250 Sport Sedan, W204 in Mercedes code. This vehicle is equipped with a 1.8L Turbo engine bosting 201hp and 229lb/ft torque paired with a seven speed auto transmission.  An excellent car for the drivers/owners who want a premium vehicle with an efficient engine, great ride, able to maneuver in emergency/sporty situations.  This is not a sportscar for the hard core drivers.  This is a comfort/luxury car for cruising and commuting.  It is bigger in the inside than what it looks like on the outside with plenty of space for four adults.  I am 5'10"" with a muscular 235 pounds and I am able to enter, sit and exit both in the front or rear seats without complaints. Only the rear center position is questionable as with most cars in this class.

Mine has 70,000 miles over four and a half years and is still solid as new with its vault-like structure.  The engine and transmission pull surefootedly.  Suspension is still firm and compliant. The doors close with a healthy thump. The front seats are still firm and supportive although they could be better.  The car feels like it could hold for at least 200,000 miles.  I previously owned two Volvos, a 2003 V40 (110,000 miles) and a 2007 V50 T5 (140,000 miles) and this MB is sturdier than both at the same mileage.  Some friends own BMWs, Audis and Infinitis with about the same mileage and already have a lot of rattles and squeaks and the interiors are not holding up well. This is where I think the long term value of this MB is really strong.

Maintenance might be expensive if you go to the dealership.  There are some easy procedures you can do yourself like replacing air and cabin filters.  You can have an oil and filter change anywhere as long as you make sure to put in good synthetic oil and an OEM MB filter.  The service reminder reset procedures are on You Tube.  The maintenance book has all the information you need to know on when to to do what.

I plan to pass this car to my wife in a couple of years.  I am already looking at the most recent C300 (W205) which boasts a lot of improvements over my W204.",1
"Good practical little car , very practical , reliable and gas saver",1
Comfy especially driving long distances. Would drive anything else.,1
"What is there not like? Made in America, excellent quality, gas mileage, ride comfort, versatility, dependability. I can't brag enough.",1
Best BMW i have ever had. still have it today!,1
"If you don't know what this car is, don't buy it. It isn't for you. It isn't a great family car, nor is it great for hauling anything more than 6 bags of moderately filled groceries (that's what the trunk holds, I measured). And make sure none of that is ice cream or cookies, because when you get home, one will be melted and the other will be fully baked.

That being said. This car is an incredible street/track machine. It's quick, handles like a dream, and has a pretty decent ride. No Lexus, but you also can't take a left hand turn at 60 safely in a Lexus. The dual-clutch gear box is solid, bit rough at times, but very quick. The seats are comfortable. Gas mileage is really around 35 on the freeway. The turbo whoosh is intoxicating. I drive it frequently on a 360 mile round trip and feel fine afterwards (I'm 6'1 and nearly 40) for reference. The interior with the exposed carbon fiber is beautiful and you will get looks everywhere. And I mean EVERYWHERE.

In it's class, you'll be looking at a Caymen, which is in every parking lot, Corvette, which if fine if you want something pedestrian, or a used exotic, which I did until I saw the insurance and maintenance costs. I absolutely love this car for what it is: a slightly loud, insanely quick, well handling, and incredibly fun car to drive. A real drivers machine.

Again, not for everyone, but if you know what you're getting, you can't go wrong.",1

I pull a 42ft. 5th wheel at 16500 lbs. 72 gal. reserve tank in bed with tool box. This is a Great Truck.",1
As advertised,1
Excellent truck with the Duramax / Allison combination,1
"Best Truck I ever owned. I have had, Rams, Silverados, Titans, etc this truck drives like a car, rides smooth, and pulls great",1
I love my Jeep Liberty it's a great running vehicle for the price and it's just a good fit for me.,1
Excellent gas mileage. Lot of room for small car and fun to drive,1
Just an extremely fun-to-drive  roadster.  2.5 liter six cylinder is more than enough power. Classic styling.,1
Excellent product.,1
"We just hit 230,000 miles without any major repairs. The biggest repair so far was the rear door latch a couple of months ago.  It hauled 2 adults and six kids around this country in all kinds of environments quite comfortably.",1
Great car.,1
"Runs great, looks great, tows my pontoon boat great and all accessories work great. The gas mileage is good for such a heavy car at 21-22 city and 26-27 hwy thanks to it's 8 speed transmission. The only issue is back seat leg room. It would be a 5 star plus if that issue was improved.",1
"After 12 years and 210,000 miles I can say this is the best car I've ever owned (and I've owned 9 others). I've just changed the oil every 3000 miles and did a tuneup at around 100,000 miles when a rough idle problem occurred, nothing but regular maintenance. The.bad news is parts availability since Saturn closed down in 2008.",1
"I did a few modifications and get 25 mpg highway on a 7.3 with 180k on it. Larger exhaust. wicked wheel on turbo. cold air intake, I deleted the plunger in the fuel filter. It restricts fuel flow and only hurts if you don't put in a fuel filter and what idiot would do that. Anyone with a 7.3 should definitely check the back pressure down tube. This gets clogged and ruins performance and make MPG go way down. I took my truck to 3 different diesel places and no one found this problem They all told me my truck was running the way it should. Search on you tube for this fix. This tube clogs and does not send a message to the sensor it is attached to and throws off the CPU. Hope this helps someone.",1
"Very reliable and safe to drive. Have had it for nine years and apart from the regular part replacements have only had to change the EGR.I was cut off on the interstate and had to brake and correct steering a few times,but had no damage and no one got hurt. It isn't top heavy as some have said.",1
I have had it for long time and it is still a great suv but im considering making it a hunting machine.,1
This is my third Silverado There is no belter truck in my opinion,1
Absolutely love this car!!,1
The AWD  is nice but have the premier edition so it's loaded. It has 173000 miles on it but still going strong.,1
"Spectacularly good vehicle! I have a AWD RTL-T. We bought it with a Honda Tonneau cover, floor mats and mud guards only. Some dealers like to load them up with a whole lot of dealer addded stuff. Which is fine if you need them, but generally you can do most of the bolt on stuff yourself and save a few bucks. Watch the tonneau though, many interfere with opening the in bed trunk lid even if they are rolled up or folded out of the way. If you buy the Honda accessories, they are warranted just like the rest of the vehicle. So, we have been very pleased with the truck, it finished very well, drives and rides like a high end auto but has the utility of a pickup. The features like the GPS and upgraded sound system work very well, but there is a learning curve just like most new vehicles with tech features. Seating is very comfortable. We did not see the value in going to the -E model. It has more features, but the price is over $4000 more and some of the stuff was unimportant to us. The running gear is the same on every model. Just decide if you want AWD or not.",1
VEHICLE SOLD,1
"i love this car, good looking and powerful, only one thing i don't have on my radio car GPS and rear camera option and i made search it seams i can't add them. if someone did it can you help thanks",1
"In 1985 there was quite a lot of buzz about the new GT-S Corolla.  Fuel Injected Twin Cam engine, sport suspension, disk brakes on all 4 corners, practicality, and best of all it was the last generation of affordable Rear Wheel Drive sport compact from Toyota.

Fast forward thirty some years to today and most people look at the AE86 corollas as a sh*tbox...  because it is!  But something happens when you sit down inside.  The steering is heavy and firm.  The car is incredibly light and nimble.  The rear wheel drive platform gives a sporty experience.  And with no driving aids whatsoever (that's right, No Traction Control, No stability Management, No blind spot indicators, Not even an Anti-Lock Braking System!) you feel every action and reaction.  This is truly a blast to drive.",1
It's very reliable.  No problem at all. Great family vehicle..,1
"Couldn't have asked for a better truck, so much power, never left me stranded",1
Love it so much.,1
"Great truck, needs very little maintenance except for what you would expect",1
One of the best investment I've made 10yrs ago 120000kms and still going strong.,1
Best AWD SUV EVER!,1
Great car.  Peppy and easy on gas.,1
great truck,1
Best truck on the market. 300k miles and drives better than new.,1
"105k miles and still running great.  But I did scheduled maintenance.  Changed transmission fluid, changed anti freeze in engine and inverter, rotated tires every 5000 miles, oil change and filter with synthetic oil every 10k, I replaced rear small 12 volt battery just this year as preventative procedure.  Replaced a few bulbs, air cabin and engine air filters too.  Brakes still like new because electro magnets do most of the braking.  A great car. Would buy again in a heart beat.  My Prius has leather seats, deluxe sound system, solar charging sun roof,  back up camera and sun roof.  Even has Toyota emergency call alert.  A great car.  Changed factory tires to Michelin MXV4 at 40,000 miles. Tires still good at 105,000 because I rotate every 5 k.  Michelin MXV4 much better handling tire than factory tires on Prius IV.  Much better tread life too.",1
"Destined to be a true classic as one of the most reliable Jaguars ever built, this is the last of the 4.0 straight six Jags. While the V8 that replaced it provided better performance, it lacked the solid reliability the 4.0 litre six provided. There is something special about this Jag that is sadly overlooked due to the reputation Jaguar had up to the 1995 model year, but is a Godsend to those wanting to own one. Be sure to get a garage queen, as you can get them for a song and restorations are super spendy. Keeping a nice Jag in good condition is inexpensive, but bringing one back from the dead is not.",1
Extremely  dependable  smooth  ride and  great handling. Not to mention  all the great feature and plush  interior design. Just a great vehicle.,1
"This was my dream truck when I was a kid. I wanted one the first time I saw a full size. This is my 3rd Bronco, and she's my baby. Anybody into wheeling and full sizes would not be disappointed at the capability of the beasts.",1
I love this car. A lot of car for such a bargain. Ive never had anything so fancy and is probably the fastest car Ive ever owned. I always get compliments on it.,1
excellent,1
My daily use car. Great car with best performance. Great for long trips and highways. I have never big issues with the car except some minors.,1
My F250 is the best vehicle I have ever purchased. The 7.3L is a work horse and will do whatever I need to do.  Very low maintenance and great fuel economy.,1
LOVE ! LOVE ! LOVE MY CAR !,1
we[[ built products same as oem,1
150000 mile and still going strong.,1
It arrived ahead of schedule. Packaged great and item as dipicted. Happy customer. And got to fix me car faster.,1
I absolutely love my car even after 5 years! Bought new and have not had an issue outside of normal maintenance! The seats are so comfortable and the buttons are easily accessible! I have the SL...I will buy another for sure! Also was a Toyota owner who switched to Nissan,1
"Only in a jeep! Great , love it, and  you won't understand if your not a fan.",1
"Bought a salvage 2015 with 13,000 miles had a friend in Connecticut replace doors etc. with all new factory parts car now has 70,000 miles runs great comfortable good gas mileage great car",1
You have a picture of the wrong truck,1
"Great minivan. Bought with 80k miles on it in 2014. Use daily ever since. Seems compacr from the outside, yet has enough room for 6 people. Other than once in a blue moon power window glitch, works really well.",1
Quick shipping and tires are awesome.,1
"Great vehicle when maintenance is kept up to date.  It goes through snow in the winter like a champ.  I've never gotten stuck, even with 18 inches of snow on the ground. I don't even bother shoveling my driveway because the car doesn't seem to notice there is snow.  My car is going on 13 years old and has 109,000 miles on it.  It still has the original clutch on a 5 speed manual transmission and a 2.5 Liter flat-4/Boxer engine.  The stock radio is finally starting to quit on me, but the speakers are holding up okay.  Even the air conditioning is working great.

The only thing wrong with my vehicle is typical of many Subarus, I go through a quart of oil every 2,000 miles.  It doesn't leak on the ground, thankfully, but is due to blow by with the normal wear and tear on the flat-4 engine.  Also, the gas mileage is lower due to the All Wheel Drive (AWD).  That is to be expected since the vehicle is putting pressure to all four wheels instead of two.  This particular year does not have a fuel filter, but the mechanics and auto parts store sell them. It took three mechanics, a Subaru parts guy, and some online digging to realize that the fuel filter does not exist.",1
Amazing ride! Uber expensive tho. Sold my whole family to get this one next car might cost me my dog cat and house,1
Cool,1
"I purchased mine about a year ago. One of the best trucks I have ever owned. Didn't need a huge truck, but needed one with the capability to do work. Has not disappointed me once. I have a Z71 with a Duramax engine!!  Well worth the $4000 cost to upgrade to that engine.",1
been a fantastically great truck,1
Really good and fast delivery I love it,1
"I absolutely adore my 740. It's been the most reliable car I have ever owned. Any parts I have needed were for general maintenance, such as spark plugs and oil filters.
The parts I did get were all inexpensive, and easy to install.",1
It fits perfect. Truck is running like new.,1
"I've owned 2 Ford Foci and they both have been great cars. The first when was a 2004 SE and was totalled after getting rear ended several years ago. So, I bought another one, a 2005 ST. I, thankfully, have not had to do any major repairs on them. Only maintenance, one starter, and all 3 motor mounts, once. My last one had high mileage at 189k with the 2.3L Duratec and a 4speed automatic trans. The one I own now is a 2.3L ST with a manual trans and that has 130k. I put both on a dyno and tested for HP/TQ loss to compare to the factory numbers. My first Focus has dropped about 20HP and 15TQ. The Focus I own now had no loss from factory numbers. It's a fun car, not very fast, but it is quick, and handles nicely. Great on gas, i was able to 420 miles on a full 13 gallon tank a couple times and is highly reliable. Parts are cheap enough for DIY maintenance. Large Focus community online and in the outside world. Definitely recommend not over looking if your deciding on getting a used car. Common failures that I'm aware of are the motor mounts, especially the one on the passenger side, and the thermostat leaking coolant on the Zetec motors.",1
"I've owned this Americanised version of the Hilux for about 20 years. This has been the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned and has never failed me. The worst problem I've had was the window regulators gave out at around 180,000 miles. If you just take care of this beautiful piece of machinery I highly suspect it will last indefinitely.",1
Awesome!,1
"I went from a 2014 2SS Camaro to the 2016 2SS. A night and day difference!!!! I had originally planned on waiting to finally get the Corvette I always wanted, that was until I test drove the 2016 2SS. It has the Corvette engine I wanted, the Magnetic Ride Control from the Corvette/ZL1 and the sound this car makes is sweet music to my ears. So I ended up buying a ""roomier Corvette""!!! I couldn't be happier with this car. Kudos, GM for doing your homework on the Gen6 Camaro.",1
Still like new after 13 years,1
As described,1
"Excellent power with the Cummins, never had any issues with the truck. I tow a 13k lbs trailer and the truck doesn't even know it's back there! Rougher ride and lacking the flawless shift of the Chevy Dmax though.",1
"Arrived on time, was an easy install",1
"Great reliability.  Other than routine maintenance, brakes, tires, etc. nothing significant has gone wrong with my Highlander.  This is the second one I've owned and I have a feeling my next vehicle will be another Highlander.  Also, it's a very smooth and quiet ride on the highway.",1
"i bought this car from org owner ,i bought it with 141500 miles ,no rust and its now got 194500 ive owned now for 6  years,the only thing ive put in this car normal wear and tear stuff.brakes tires ,stabilzer pins,car has the 3.2 ho v6.  ,car drives very nice the only complaint i have it does go through stabilizer links every 10000 miles ,other wise if you can fine a clean one owner buy it ,or its twin the 300m or lhs all good cars it now has 208060 miles best dam car i have ever owned just normal were and tear",1
My 2nd one . The o5 with sun roof is my fav,1
Very easy to install and fit perfect tailgate works great now,1
"Very good power for a 4 cyl, reliable, 31mpg Hwy. No complaints.",1
"The only negative is the MPG, but that's expected with the V10.",1
Best car ever! Engine and transmission are perfect for this car. Economical and fun to drive. Upgraded disc pads to Hawk for more stopping power. Would recommend buying this car if you want reliable economical transportation.,1
"350/turbo 400/NP241C/14 bolt rear, 9.25 IFS front. It's a tough truck. It doesn't get good mileage but if you were looking for a commuter car, you wouldn't be looking at this type of truck anyway. 12.5 mpg on my best combined tank. 7.8 on my worst. No overdrive so the 4.10:1 gears really let the motor sing on the interstate. 2500 rpms in 3rd gear at 55mph with 245/75R16s but it sounds great doing it with headers and open exhaust coming out of the stock single 3"" tailpipe. It has plenty of power and runs strong.
  It's gonna be a tight squeeze in the regular cab if you have more than 2 people, but if they are adventurous, they can just ride in the roomy 8' bed.
  It has 3/4 ton springs so it rides like a truck, not a cushy car. It's built heavy and strong so I'm not worried about breaking anything when I abuse it.
  I've got several other newer vehicles (I only own 2 older ones) but I choose this one to be my daily driver. 5 stars.",1
Love my RAM,1
"Ive had a 2012, 2015 and now the 2017. Ive loved them all but I REALLY love this one. They now make a 4 cyl and if I hadnt driven it, I would have totally passed on it. I go just as fast as the others (shhhh) and its GREAT on gas. That makes me extremely happy since gas prices are going up again (grrr). I can go a week on a tank of gas when I used to have to refill mid-week. It has leather seats that you can heat or cool and the display for the different features is amazing. I never thought I could love a car this much but I really love this one and it really makes me love to drive.",1
"2016 SE is a great ride, tons of room, and very comfortable. Highly recommend it. I really like that the 8th seat (FWD) can be stored in the back when it isn't needed, and the SE leather seats are better than the XLE.",1
"Bought this truck 13 years ago and it's still going strong.  My vehicle has an 8 liter V8 and special towing equipment, and is used primarily to tow a 35 foot fifth wheel trailer.",1
As much fun as 557 horses can give you - without the mess!!,1
"Fits like a glove !! Just what I wanted, excellent fit and great design.",1
Loved it - but traded it in for a newer 2017 version this year...and actually wish I had my 2013 back!!!,1
"This has all the ""bells and whistles"" and it's is NICE.  Front camera, back camera, park assist, seats that heat and cool, park assist.....the list goes on!",1
Love the car steers like a pig,1
I love how easy this was to program to my truck!!,1
Great Car!,1
"This was an awesome car from the interior down to the 5.3L Vortec V8. Put over 200,000 miles on an LTZ trim and only had one exhaust leak in all that time. Eventually sold for a 2010 Escalade with a few more bells and whistles but it's really not the same. I still enjoy the late model (13-14) styling a bit more than the newer ones. One of the best and most reliable vehicles ever made.",1
Loved this car so much that I purchased a new one and the old one given to my daughter.,1
Best truck I ever owned great mileage and performance.,1
This is the most amazing car I have ever owned !!!,1
More of a car with h a truck bed but its all the truck I need!,1
my god. What more can you ask for? base 2jz rwd and reliable as ever. I recommend anyone who wants a supra but don't want to break the bank. Look into one of these cars bruh. Handles amazing. luxury loaded. Comes auto unless your lucky enough to find the few that come in a handy dandy 5 speed but easy to swap over to 5 speed. Great cruiser. Love this car. Would happily buy another one. I will say this car bone stock is more of a cruiser,1
"The Camry XLE I have was my grandmothers before me and she gave it to us when they got a new car. I love this thing to death, I wish it had a little more power and could accelerate a little bit faster for those close call moments. The only issues mine has had after many many miles (I'll update later) Is the left passenger seat window failing and the timing belt snapping due to poor maintenance on my part. If you find one of these in good condition I can't see how you can go wrong If you treat it right it will return the favor five fold.",1
Awesome,1
One of the best cars I have ever owned. Not the fastest out there but still the best.,1
Excellent Vehicle. Nothing else like a Wrangler,1
16 trailhawk . Taken me to new places and introduced me to new people. We take it on trails and have a group set up now.,1
"This car is a winner. You will not find a more reliable and utilitarian car, especially for the cost. Not to mention the 2000 outback model certainly was bestowed with beauty.",1
"Works good, rides smooth, easy to work on and reliable but the styling is a bit strange.",1
Great car very reliable,1
I've heard horror stories about the 300...but I love my 09!!,1
"So far I am very impressed with this truck. Quiet, smooth and very good gas milage ( 25-29) mpg. Should last a long time.",1
"Love my Avalon! Reliable, comfortable, great gas mileage and looks classy!",1
"Best vehicle I have ever owned. The only problem is with emission control valves, and only once in a while.",1
There is absolutely nothing about the Dodge Avenger that I do not like. The car is beautiful on the outside and the inside. Gas mileage is excellent. The motor purrs like a kitten and is ready to roar like a lion when need be. It's both sporty and stylish. A four door sedan slash sports car. I plan to add a Dodge Charger to my family in the very near future.,1
one of the best cars that I have owned.,1
Best truck on earth 200 and 20000 my best truck ever,1
"I bought my truck new with 50 miles on it, she now how's 387,684. Drive it everyday it has taken me from the east coast to the west coast, from the gulf to Canada! She has been a good one.",1
"I love my Ram truck. I drove a brand new Ford F150 before I bought my Ram 1500 and I thought the Ram was so much  nicer.
More power, better ride, nicer interior, etc.
This thing has 390 hp and still gets better gas mileage than my previous Toyota Tacoma.",1
Greatest truck!!!,1
Perfectly fits in my car and great price,1
Perfect fit,1
Great car but maintenance costs high,1
This is an absolutely beautiful vehicle. It have a 5.0L V8 and run so smooth. This is the vehicle everyone should own.,1
This is my 3rd one. Good bang for the buck.,1
excellent parts stock,1
best car i have ever owned.,1
Best truck I've ever owned.,1
Thanks,1
"Great mini van, 190,000 miles still run like new van without any major problem, need only new head light, tail, tires, etc...",1
"Love this car! It's comfortable, and although it's a 1999 model, the body style has held up well. Mine is in particularly great condition, having been garage kept by the previous owner. It could pass for a 2 or 3 year old car. The large supercharged V-6 makes it pretty speedy (a few mods didn't  hurt either :) )
Roomy enough to be a family car.",1
"I have had my Durango RT for almost a year, love the black out.  The technology is great, and love the sound of that V8. It is my ""bad"" mom vehicle. It also did great towing our travel trailer. Also a very quite ride down the road, holds 6 people which is a plus for the price point.",1
"Best vehicle I've ever owned. Not fast, but so what. 5speed, tough,reliable and fun to drive! Can't beat that combo!",1
Great truck,1
"Ive own a couple Benzs now and this is by far best sedan Ive owned. Because The S Class 500 AMG is smoother, quiet, and makes you feel like your floating on clouds. Had an E430 Sports model andThe E class is louder(lot less insulation interior but has outstanding gas mileage. My Current Benz S class isn't too bad on gas but its fast stylist and extremely luxury that makes you feel like your going in style every time you go somewhere!",1
"Awesome vehicle, fun to drive!",1
"I have owned this 1998 Ranger pickup for over 10 years. The motor & transmission work as good as the day I bought it. Of course
other things that go wrong with older vehicles, I repaired quickly and it is good as ever. Best vehicle i have ever owned.",1
"I've owned Chevy, Dodge and Ford 4X4 trucks for the past 50 years.  My new ZR2 is amazing, nothing better on the mid-sized truck market.  Roomy cab, great fuel economy, excellent ride and handling.  The ZR2 is unstoppable offroad.  I love this truck.",1
I love my 15 Diesel. I am getting 16.7 mpg all around and over 19 on the highway. The truck is comfortable and shines pulling a load. I should have done this years ago.,1
All the products that I already get in amazon for my 2007 Frontier matched perfectly with the truck. The good prices are a plus.,1
"Has been a wonderful, dependable vehicle. Is still used as my daily driver with 285,000 miles - no major mechanical issues, only general maintenance.",1
"Bought used with only 10,000 miles on it. Just a basic car which has work very well. Great ride! Great value.",1
This chevys been really good to me all of the upgrades and any problems i have repaired have been really easy to do,1
The 2017 sierra rides and handles great.  Glad I traded my Chevy silverado for this GMC.,1
It's a very good.will tell others.,1
"I bought my 2011 Focus in 2010 with 2.2 miles on it (after my test drive), and I now have 105,000 after a recent trip to Phoenix.  I've changed the oil and filter every 3000 miles, and just before my recent drive I changed to synthetic on advice of my auto mechanic.  I've been getting between 33.5 and 36.4 miles per gallon, depending on terrain and speed.  I have very good acceleration and super braking, and love the maneuverability of this car.  I have no repairs at this point (except replacing the windshield that took a rock from a lawn mower), and I do take all my cars to the mechanic once a year for general maintenance and being checked out.  Everything related to power windows, door locks, the main electrical, etc., works great, and I did take it in to Car Toys several months ago to install a nice Pioneer touch-screen stereo and new Infinity speakers.  Planning on keeping this vehicle for many more years.",1
I have a 2006  Tacoma 4 door love the performance & look of it would but another 2mmrow the only thing is wish it was a 4x4,1

"Have not idea why I was asked to rate ""Old Blue"" - my 1986 Ford F-250 (Diesel/Standard Shift), but here goes.  Bought in new and paid a little over $19,000 for it.  Also have a 2015 F-250 that cost over $62,000.  Not sure the ""16"" will last as long as the ""89"" as it  has too many bells and whistles that are sure to fail (like my navigation system that sucks).  My 89 Ford runs as good now as it did when I picked it up.  Only issue I have had with it the past 28-years is that I had to replace the fuel injector pump and 2 of the glow plugs.  No rust and it looks like a collector's vehicle.
Sal.",1
Love it,1
great little sporty car. I love it!!!,1
"A fantastic long distance hauler.  The fit and finish are excellent, the ride is smooth but still athletic.  I have the diesel version and despite this being a heavy car (with full time AWD), it returns very good fuel economy.

Could not be happier with the car.",1
"Bought it new in november 99. It has been a great car. Very little trouble and has obout 210,000 miles now.",1
"This is actually my son's vehicle, and he loves it.  His has the second row seats and side windows, so it is more like a car than a work van. He can carry his bicycles securely inside the back, and has plenty of room to carry almost anything else he needs.",1
"Great place to order my parts for my 1965 Chevy Impala ,Happy so far.

Great quality. Last of a dead breed! The next model and beyond are garbage.,1
Your dad drove a van for a reason.,1
Love My Dodge Hemi! RT Plus Black top Package,1
"yah gotta put a bullet into this beast to stop it. parts are cheap, easy to find, and is generally easy to work on.",1
"This is great truck for towing, hauling or just taking a trip.  I have the 8.1 liter with the allison transmission, 4x4, extended cab, 3/4 ton.  This combination makes for reliable solid truck.  The engine transmission combo is perfect for pulling anything.  I've had this truck for over ten years with only small problems.  The paint on the plastic moldings does not hold up well after 5 years.  The upper steering control arm has always had the occasional  rattle, the passenger air bag sensor stopped working after ten years and I had to replace a heater vent door actuator and the headliner is starting to sag.  (All easy fixes.)  The truck gets about 8 to 14 MPG depending how and where you drive.  I have really gotten my monies worth out of this truck.  I'm sure it will go another 10 years with little to no problems.",1
Exhaust fit just as said. Very happy,1
"I've owned my Flex since Fall 2012 and still love it. If I crashed it tomorrow, I would buy another. My only regret is not having the passenger power point under the dash looked at. I can't recall it ever working but ignored it since 1)It's the passenger's power point and 2) I figured it was just a fuse. I have since checked all the fuses and the connector to it behind the dash panel. My advice would be to have every issue checked while under warranty even if it seems silly.",1
"The truck runs and looks great and we have not had any problems with it. It is an XLT super crew so their is much room inside the cab. The seats are comfortable, especially the front ones. The back seats are a little hard to sleep on because the back of them is straight. When we first got the truck over 5 years ago the ride was smoother than it is now. Also, because of its length it is hard to park in a parking space because it is not easy to judge where the white line is ahead of you.
In spite of the downsides, I would recommend it highly to anyone!",1
"Purchased our highlander new in May of 2016, it was a gift for my wife who was pregnant at the time with our third child. We decided we wanted something with seating for more than just our family and we're not minivan people. We got the LE PLUS AWD in Blizzard Pearl. We did not want leather seats, so we decided against the XLE. We still got all the XLE toys except the sunroof, and cosmetics like the chrome roof rails. Seating for 8, power lift gate, protection package (door edge guards, wheel locks, body color door moldings, and rear bumper protector). We had a 4-Runner for a week or so on a test drive, but really didn't want another ""truck"" as we already have a Tacoma. The Highlander was perfect, and we love it. It's rated the number one SUV in its class, Toyota reliability and resale... very happy.",1
"I've been asked to review my car...wow, ok.

1984, late in the year. I'm 14 years old and we pull behind a new car at a stop light. The word ""Supra"" across the back...I've wanted one ever since.
It's been a labor of love and fulfilment of a dream, I guess. Found my 85 Celica/Supra on eBay and won it for $200. Rented a car dolly and towed it home. Swapped the engine, rack and pinion, new tires, a couple wheels, windshield, seals, brakes, struts clutch set and lots of minor body work. I have a daily drive to work car (when it's not snowing). It's fun to drive, runs and handles well. Its not fast by todays standards, but it goes just fine.",1
"I love this Jeep. Comfortable, fun to drive. great power and gas mileage, considering the AT tires and stance. Endlessly customizable...",1
Great car for the money,1
"great car I love it, really power full, comfortable, if you don't mind about gas consumption, it is a amazing car to drive",1
"Mine is still going strong at 218,000. Stay on top of maintenence, oil and timing belts, and it will take care of you.",1
Excelent machine.,1
Fit my 2016 Nissan frontier sv perfectly.product was easy to install and makes truck look good. I would definitely recommend this product,1
"I inherited this from my Grandmother with very low mileage. It's still a very durable, and functional family vehicle. The only parts that have been replaced the are the door handles on the driver side, and sliding passenger doors. I had to also replace the radio, as it just died one day.",1
"Great car!
180,000 miles,  and I'm still a happy camper!",1
Best truck I have ever had,1
Awesome car. Solid. Great stereo. But it drives like a truck. For the price it's the best,1
2004 Mercury Mountaineer has 106500 miles on it. It is the 2wd version with 4.0 V6. Has been a good vehicle with no major problem. Does not get good gas mileage.,1
Great car. I loved the car when I had it.,1
"Love my Highlander.  I transport dogs and often put a large carrier in.  I can get three large dogs in the car without a problem.  My car has also been very reliable, which is a big plus for me.",1
"Runs great, mileage is excellent, seats very comfortable and adjustable ( I have the LX model - not electric seats) I haven't taken it out on a long trip yet, but am looking forward to it. It's everything my 2003 Pilot was, in a smaller package.
Update: After a few months just feeling something was not right with the handling, and then getting a flat from a rock chip, I replaced the tires with some all season tires. What a difference! Better handling, and much better traction. If you buy a new CRV, invest in some good tires.",1
Car has 25000 miles on it now  best purchase  ever made,1
"Our Odyssey Touring has served us well for nearly 8 years and 80,000 miles.  It has enough technology to keep everyone entertained and regular maintenance has rewarded our family with a reliable, comfortable vehicle.  Absolutely no complaints other than the PAX tires on some Touring models, which we swapped out to great ride and handling improvement.",1
Best crossover that I own,1
"I have had it back one time for a recall on exhaust programing. They changed the oil once then
I have done it. Bought it to pull a 5th wheel with the 6.7 turbo diesel...pulls it without a grunt.
Great truck so far.",1
"I have the E550 coupe, very stylish and have put on custom TSW wheels. The engine-transmission duo are the best I have ever driven with near perfect steering and performance; and bi-turbo V8 is scary fast. German engineering plus beautiful finish outside and luxury interior artistry all make this car a masterpiece.  The electronics are much improved over the years, but not as intuitive or reliable as the Asian cars  And MBs are not maintenance free--they require tune ups and re-fits and so on, and upkeep can be expensive after 4 year 50,000 mile warranty disappears.",1
246k and still driving it to work every day,1
"It's good for hunting things. It got wrecked but we repaired it, all in all a good car for the family buisness.",1
Love the car. very reliable and dependable. Good acceleration even after 10 years of ownership. All i have to do is change oil and fluids regularly. do major issus whatsoever.,1
Love my  Nissan Murano !! Just like driving a luxury car.  Very roomy and extremely reliable.  Maintenance is minimum for a all wheel drive SUV.,1
"I live deep in the snow belt of northern New England.  About every third car around here is some sort of Subaru, and there is a
good reason for that.  Does not get stuck in mud or snow,  Does not break down.  Good MPG.  Plenty of room for your outdoor
sports gear.  Smooth easy driving on interstate, and still able to get up monster hill to my house during a blizzard.  Reasonably priced.
Long lasting. Excellent resale value.",1
"This is my second 2008 Honda Pilot - my first one was destroyed in Superstorm Sandy.  Even though it was 4 years later, I liked the model year so much I bought another one with almost 60K miles on it.  It has now been over 4 years and no problems - I have it serviced regularly and follow the maintenance schedule in the Owner's Manual.  The car has over 103K miles and runs great.  It also handles exceptionally well in the snow.  I also like the fact that it has the 3rd row seating so when our family goes out we don't have to take two cars  I really can't say enough good things - this is the 10th car I have owned since I started driving and I have to say it is my favorite.",1
"Best 4WD in the world. Legendary Toyota Reliability, and it has two solid axles, w/ three rows of seating. Everyone gets to hit the trail in this beast. The 4.5l straight 6 gives you good low end torque, and with regular maintenance will never let you down. Mine has 286,000 miles and purrs like a kitten.",1
Arrived in a timely manor. Looked exactly like my old ones and fit perfect. Looks like I will only need make a minor adjustment in the alignment. Like them.,1
Good reliable car.,1
"Most comfortable vehicle I ever drove.  No real expense toward up keep 2009 with 101,586 miles and many more I hope.",1
"Love the comfortable seats, dual air and remote start.",1
"My mechanic advised me to purchase one -- he said they just keep running.  That is true, no problems after all this time.  I love it!!",1
FAST and a top notch car,1
Good history; minor maintenance in 11 years.,1
"I've had my TT Roadster for 16 years now and I love it. I've found that Audis aren't known for their wonderful electrical systems, so it has spent a lot of time in the garage, dead, unless I drive it every day. It does just fine in the snow, but since the car is very close to the ground I've tried not to use it if there is over 4 inches of fresh snow on the road. On the other hand, it has gotten me home in unexpected blizzards a couple of times.",1
"Purchased my Cavalier brand new in 2003. Had 3 miles on it, now 132,000 and it still purr's like a kitten. Great gas mileage too. (drove 500 miles and still had 3/4 of a tank of gas left)  Very,very happy with my Cavie!!",1
"Best car for the money. Period, and the newer Mazda 3's get another 10 miles to the gallon. This is my second M3 and has 165k miles with oil changes and minor tune-ups only. I just ran into a client with one that has over 220k miles.... same deal. Greatest car for the money ever.",1
After owning this car for a little over a year I thing it must have been designed by a mechanic. Ive only had to replace 2 items (brakes and crank sensor) and both were easy. This thing is a tank that is running strong at 245k miles!,1
"Great car, No issues and great mileage! Love it!",1
Great.. 10 minutes to install..,1
This lights fit like oem. The delivery was super fast,1
best overall vehicle I've ever owned..345k miles and still going on the original engine.,1
"No problems with this van, bought it new and now it has 86.000 miles just tires were replaced, nothing else, basic maintenance due on time of course.",1
Great!,1
"This has been a fantastic vehicle. My son has been using It for the last 3 years and it had over 220,000 on it when we got it. Easy to work on and has been very durable and reliable with minimum maintenance.",1
Good,1
"It is a very comfortable and reliable car. Too bad it's discontinued in North America! Almost 165k miles on it, with minor issues so far.",1
Good car. Almost 200k miles nothing wrong besides routine maintenance.,1
175.000 miles with no problems,1
This is the second 2005 F250 diesel I have owned. The only reason i sold the first one was it was a 2wd. There are some minor bugs that should be worked out with most of 6.0 but when they are taken care of the trucks are solid fir a long ling time. Gonna buy another soon but only because I want a long bed.,1
Excellent car. Great ride and power. Good on gas. Very classy interior as well.,1
Never been disappointed at this purchase. Love my Suki....,1
"I was looking for an older, inexpensive pick up for home and yard improvement work.  Not a daily driver.  The vehicle I found needed a little mechanical work to get through inspection.  It is not pretty - bumps and scratches, interior is a little rough - but it runs great and does the job I needed it for.",1
"170,000 miles and going strong!

Superb handling and refined features make the 2011+ series Odyssey the best choice for my family, and as a man - I love it! I often get the guys at work asking why I didn't get something more manly like a big SUV... well it comfortably seats 8, handles better, eats less gas, fits more stuff, and is easier to get things (oh, and kids) in and out of. And on days it might rain, it is my first choice for trips to Home Depot where after 60 seconds to remove the middle row seats I can lay full sheets of drywall flat and keep them 100% dry. Friends need help moving? My truck is only good for the really bulky or heavy stuff. The Odyssey fits more boxes and miscellaneous, no strapping necessary, and keeps everything locked and dry.

Driving performance does not suffer. With a low center of gravity and surprisingly good handling, the Odyssey rocks tight fast corners at least as well as your average sedan. Dont tell my wife how often I drive it like I stole it. I may not have the 4WD to pull anyone out of a mud hole (when was the last time you needed to do that?), but I can tow my boat.

Other bonuses you may not find elsewhere:
* Refrigerated cool box in the dash.
* One switch to turn off the lights the kids left on in the back.
* Back row folds flatter and faster than the competition.

I do my own maintenance and have very little to complain about. The maintenance minder system tells me what is due and when. The only things unexpected were having to replace a CV axle and an oil pressure switch (did I mention 170k miles?). Brakes are not the best - apparently decent ceramic pads are too much for the rotors and will warp them in 10k miles. After my third set of rotors, I finally gave up and went to overpriced OEM semi-metallic pads and so far so good.

Anyway, of course the wife and kids love our Odyssey, but the big news is: so do I.",1
Best vehicle I've ever owned. Great performance and fuel mileage.  The quality is amazing just the touch and feel of the vehicle alone give you a sense of quality. I traded in a 2014 crew cab Z71 Silverado for this F150 best decision I ever made.,1
Good Truck priced right,1
"Owned a 2008 Jeep until it was totaled then purchased The 2014 Jeep Wrangler Willy's special edition, love both but the new one came with many more features and upgrades like the rear lockers that only come with rubicon was in my package. Extremely happy with my purchase and glad I spoke to many Jeep owners and former owners. Owners happy ex owners wish they never got rid of theirs.",1
solid as it comes,1
"I'm a big fan of Honda.  My husband has had an Acura for nearly a decade, and my previous vehicle was a Civic.  The Civic was great, but we needed more space once we started a family.  I am not a big vehicle kind of person.  What I really like about the CR-V is that it provides the extra space we need for the car seat and cargo, but it drives like a car with the power of an SUV.  It's pretty fuel efficient and even the standard features on the lesser models are very nice.  When my lease is up, I plan to finance another CR-V.",1
"17 years old, and still runs and looks great.",1
"I have the Silver edition and really love the performance of my Pathfinder. The 4.0, 6 cylinder feels like a V8 and I still manage to get 18.5mpg as long as I'm not too abusive with the pedal. I have not personally towed anything with my Pathfinder, but I imagine it performs well towing as I have seen Pathfinders around pulling serious trailers and boats. My only complaint is that folding the middle seats down can be a pain especially if the strap gets buried, but easy to get back up after use. Also one of my shield underneath seem to be rattling, but that is minor as well.",1
"I love the 2010 Chrysler town and country wouldn't give it up for nothing, best van on the planet, I'm Town and Country forever.",1
its a excellent car had no problems and gets great gas mileage,1
"I've had my 2007 AWD Fusion for over 10 years.  Driven up to Alaska from Virginia,  all across the country with out an issue.",1
"Best truck I've ever owned very little maintenance other than the norm oil changes etc. just put new brakes on it for the first time after 160,000+ miles I'm the original owner.",1
Excellent,1
The best truck ever,1
Best truck I've owned.  Strong great on fuel.,1
I have the 5-speed wagon and my husband has the sedan-not our firsts-best cars ever!,1
Lowest maintenance car I've owned,1
An excellent pick up having no problems at all,1
"Are you a movie star, president, king or pimp?  This piece of timeless luxury with reverse opening hood and doors (suicide) is the way to go.  With that flat slabside look and seating up to six in the car, there's also still room in the trunk to carry all of your party supplies.  If you haven't been paying attention that is room for you and 5 hot ass chicks to cruise to whatever penthouse suites you.  I can guarantee that this car will cost you more than average to maintain than your run of the mill classic but then again... money ain't no thang when you own and operate one of these cars.  Everywhere you go, you'll be breakin necks and droppin panties.  Ratchet up that experience by joining a Lincoln specific car club where you can find assistance with the knowledge to maintain your ride with ideas on things to buy from Amazon.  Examples: tools, tune up parts, vacuum hoses (good lord buy in bulk), replacement underwear for all those hotties that keep losing them.  Whatever you call this car, Suicide Slab, Slabside, Ghetto Sled... just know that if you are a car enthusiast, this will be the greatest challenge, yet the highest reward.",1
"Toyotas = hard to kill
Basic maintenance will take you a long way. Period Oil change is a must",1
This has been a great product. In 10 years all we have done is standard maintenance. They are't cheap but they do last.,1
"I love my 04 F150 Haritage. The one problem I find is a lot of stuff is not listed for it but if you go to 03 the items are the same and will fit.
Mine only has 50K on it now in 2017 and has the little 6 in it. Great truck I have owned it now for 9 months and keep buy things for it on Anazon, latest is the power window kit from Blikns to be installedthis weekend and a review to follow.",1
ordered this truck new just as I wanted been happy with it for 19 years . have 205 k miles on it runs great. can't understand why there isn't more aftermarket support of these trucks lots were built and they are great AMERICAN trucks with v8s in them,1
"Had it since new. only 60,000 miles , just ready for tire replacement. No problems since 12,000 miles rear brakes an rotors were bad dealer would not warranty. Now 48,000 miles later they are still going. I think the dealer was wrong not to warranty brakes and rotors at 12,000 miles.
Been really nice car and really nice when the times you need to haul 6 people",1
"Great cheap efficiant pocketbook freindly car. Only issue is finding parts nowadays, they are getting hard to come by. Mine has over 277000 miles currently",1
My wife loves this car and so do I. AWD and a seven passenger! Too bad they stopped making them.,1
"196k miles on it and the engine still runs like it came out of the factory yesterday. Granted I take meticulous care of it. But I still love driving this car everyday.  I'm someone who likes to work on the car too, nothing crazy but suspension,  exhaust, brakes etc and it's very easy to work on.  The other thing I like about it is how smooth and quiet it runs. Feels like a much more expensive car than it really is.",1
"My 02 civic SI is the best car I have ever owned. Despite issues with the OBD computer that caused me to replace many expensive parts I still love it, it's just a fun car to drive and has lots of storage room for all my ""junk"". I put a full sized water heater from Lowes in the back one day and brought it home. A bunch of guys in the parking lot couldn't believe it! The platform was also built in the UK on the same line that does the Cooper minis.",1

Great timely service and product looks the same as the ome.,1
Great mpg and fits my 6ft7 husband and 3 kids,1
"Bought brand new and still going strong. 404,000 miles on my Duramax of pulling trailers daily with heavy loads. it's been the best vehicle I've ever purchased. Only major problem was transmission pump seal replaced at around 125,000 but everything else is original. I have purchased power steering pump, front bearings, starter, alternator, radiator hoses and serpentine belt in case they do go out. If they all make it to 450,000, I will replace them regardless. Look forward to 1 million miles and further. Extremely pleased with my Chevy 2500 HD.
New entry on June 21, 2018: truck now has 455012 miles, still going strong with everything I mentioned above. I have replaced the items I mentioned and including its change of all fluids from transmission to power steering fluid. Truck still pulling a trailer daily as its my work vehicle now and I pull trailers from 16 dump trailers to 36 goosenecks. I did have a part fail about 10k miles ago, the pitman arm broke as I was making a turn but lucky it was at low speed in a rural area. Truck is amazing getting about 15 mpg.",1
Great quality and dependibilty.  Fun to drive.,1
Save gas and run fast on tha road.,1
NOW WE HAVE  2 OF THEM!!!,1
love it,1
"I have had a 1966 Scout for over 30 years. I love these early Scouts. never had a newer one. This is what Ford copied almost to a ""T"" when they introduced the Bronco. Stole all the dimensions and all. So, basically, a Bronco is what I call a ""Scout Clone"". These old Scouts aren't for everybody. They are noisy, drafty, bouncy, but also fun as heck to own and drive. There is something to be said about Simplicity.",1
bad ass hemi  no regrets,1
I've owned 3 other Mark viii cars. They are great to drive and a sleeper if you look for the light to light fun.,1

Best car ever! The answer is always Miata!,1
"A sturdy small tyke with heart.  We got ours during the end of it's style, so Honda make a Special Edition version and this is what we bought.  It had everything a CRV of it's model could be tarted up with, wood paneling, roof racks, sun roof, a different front grill and bumper, leather seats and All-Wheel drive with 2 low manual gears.  If you knew how to pump it, it would prove to have some power and speed.  Unfortunately though, this model could not accommodate a Honda Navigation device.  The console was just not large enough, but hell, we had 5 or 6 disc player with cassette tape.  Woo hoo.  What impressed me the most is that this vehicle was what we used for long trips.  I've driven this on the beaches of Galveston and Pensacola, even through a storm in Louisiana riding through puddles and low visibility.  The all wheel drive made driving over ice easy.  What really impressed me the most, was that in 2008, I bought another car, the Honda Accord.  The 1st of the new line of body.  So we had the last and the 1st so to say.  The accord was great for city driving and that's what I would recommend it  for, at least the 4 cylinder variety.  We kept both cars and in 2013 or 2014, the Accord started having major issues like the front wheel drive computer had to be replaced.  Compared to the beating I gave the CRV, the Accord fell way behind in terms stability and reliability.  We kept the CRV for 10 years and it was still in such good shape.",1
"This truck is a 100% work horse, bought new and have had to do very little repair work, 23 miles to the gallon.",1
great,1
"Liked most: 207000 miles and doesn't burn oil. Still has original shocks. Still has new car pep. Paint still good. No rattles. Still gets excellent gas mileage.  Still looks stylish.
Liked Least:  Ignition switch has worn out 2 times. Fixed myself so no new expensive key necessary.",1
Best diesel dually made.  We had to replace the aluminum wheels because the were poorly made and cracked.  Also the transmission about 135000 miles because I didn't change the fluid.  Just a warning to change this every 50000 miles or spend $5000 on another one  Hauls our 4000 pound slide in with no problem  Love my truck,1

"Mustang is great, reliable and American made, everyone should have one!",1
"It's the wife's vehicle;  She researched, chose, and bought it, used. I usually drive it, because she is handicapped and has poor night vision. But, when she drives it, she enjoys ""Apex"" (nicknamed for the goal of every mountaineer, the apex). It had roughly 180,000 miles on it, when purchased. I did a complete brake pad replacement. It was a value, even with replacing the tires and a full tuneup. We had to have a mechanic work on the air conditioner. Recently, my wife was struck in the rear while driving ""Apex"";  however, with the damages tallied, the insurance companies were able to repair instead of totaling ""Apex"". I compare the ride to a Cadillac (smooth), and the handling to a TR-7 (crisp and tight). Although the fit was tight, we have had seven people (2 in front, 3 kids in middle, and two adults in third seats, and no complaints of discomfort). We shop mostly once a month, so, we carry two large coolers, and still have decent space, when the third seat is down. Shame that Ford discontinued the Mercury brand; Explorers aren't as nice and Lincolns cost TOO much. If you can find one of  these gems, you'll be glad to have it in your driveway, because, neither the 2015 Dodge Journey nor the 2015 Nissan Rogue hold a candle to this personality-clad go-getter.",1

"I love this car, absolutely beautiful, manual transmission too. It's very quiet and super luxurious for its price.

"Pros:
Not much larger than a midsize sedan.
Roomy front seats

Quiet on the highway

Cons.
Cringy fuel economy compared to a similar sized hatchback.
Strange vibrations that seems to come and go randomly.
Pre 2010 Kia quality control.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I won't lie, when I heard that I was getting this car I wasn't very exited. I'm not into large vehicles like the Sorento. After driving it for awhile I will admit that I see why people want a car like this. Great viability from all directions, roomy cargo space, takes a dirt road like a champ, and all at a crazy affordable price. Kia sold this car brand new at a price that astonishes me, the price a great condition used one goes for is even more astonishing. I have the RWD automatic with the smaller of the two v6 engines. This thing is dead silent from the inside compared to my old 1998 Honda Accord. Everything just... works and it has a very basic no frills interior that while not very inspiring, is still comfortable to sit in. Fuel economy is nothing to write home about, way worse than a similarly sized sedan or hatchback. Overall I think the car is a great daily driver that is hard to beat at the prices you can currently find them at.",1
great car!,1
"I absolutely love love love my 2014 Jeep wrangler unlimited sport ;)
Got all the great extras from Amazon!",1
great truck,1
Great mid size SUV with creature comfort and smooth ride. We picked the bench seat second row and it's great. Reliable economical SUV option with a proven track record.,1
I love our van. It is very reliable. The engine is pretty much bullet proof (meaning it doesn't ever give any problems). 125k miles and this car still runs like it is brand new. It is big enough to accommodate 4 large britax car seats and have room for a couple of adults. We love our van.,1

"I have a 98 Honda Accord Coupe EX V6 vtech Dark emerald green  I sold to my mother who passed away 7 years ago with only 44, 000 . When selling Hondas we got the news about the new accord coupe. At the time we were getting 1 a month. They were sold right off the truck. I told my folks to get the EX loaded with the Costco buy ,  Costco has the dealers giving the cars away only for a few hundred offer cost. My 98 is 19 years old with 129.000 miles still fast and a great ride

only real complaint is the dark emerald paint clear coat is cracked and flacking off",1
"I bought my Magnum in April 2011 with 186,000 miles. Today it has over 280,000 miles and I couldn't be happier if I wanted to be. For being my first car this thing has been not only reliable, but such a good platform to learn how to take care of a car. Cooking system is a breeze if you pay attention to what the car needs. Dont let low coolant be the death of the vehicle. Top it off! These cars at known to have heating issues but if you put in a 60/40 coolant to water mix. Youll neve have an issue. Oil; get yourself a pair of Purolator oil filters and be aware of the change intervals. Once a year I run a half a can plus a splash of Seafoam motor treatment through the crankcase when Im 250-300 miles from the change day. Baby the car when its in park, and drive it like its stolen.",1

"Love. Love. Love. This car. I know. It's a minivan. But if you need a minivan then this is THE minivan.
Drives great. Amazing in the snow ( all wheel drive option)
Only thing I'll say....
My version comes with the run flat tires. Which worked great when I had a flat tire and was able to drive all the way home. But then, I had to replace the run flat tires.
Not only are the ridiculously expensive, they are never available. Always on back order. There is no spare tire in the car.
I opted for toyo all weathers and bought myself a AAA membership-really, am I actually ever going to change a tire, on a minivan full of kids? Nope.
Otherwise. Love this car. No problems.",1

The 1.4L turbo motor is great on gas, and there are a few vendors now for performance parts. I have 60k with no major issues. My choice was purely emotional on this car, because I owned a string of Fiats in high school, while my dad had a '67 Alfa Romeo in the same color as my Dart. I was attracted to the Fiat underpinnings and engine - this car is based on the Alfa Romeo Giulietta!",1
"To start, the car is attractive from any angle. It looks modern and cutting edge, even today in 2016. It still turns heads. That's saying something for a car I purchased for low$$$ and that has a fading clear coat. Like any car, it needs maintenance. Do not let that timing belt break or wear out. This is a costly part due to intense labor. I saved $$$$ by doing it myself. I had to replace both oxygen sensors, bought them both (Denso) here on amazon for around $100. Again, I performed this myself and saved. The car was purchased with 141,xxx miles and I now have 145,xxx miles on it. Not one problem. Of course, I went through all mechanical/electrical systems for piece of mind. I slightly used Haynes manual was purchased off Ebay for $8, this is mandatory for any car, especially one that's older. YouTube also has been instrumental in helping me start and complete the much feared and dreaded waterpump/timing belt change. While I had it apart, I changed out all idler pulleys, tensioner pulley and tensioner spring. The crankshaft seal didn't weep, nor did the camshaft seals weep, so I left those alone. Back to the car. Insurance is cheap $126 for liability for the year. I average anywhere from 28-33mpg and that is including the occasional spirited run, 145,000 miles, 225/50/15 summer tires, 2.5 v6 and 5 speed manual. So fuel economy is good in my book. Its very fun when the roads turns twisty, even more so with the slightly wider 225 width tires and moderate, not extreme 2"" Megan Racing Sport Spring suspension drop. 90% of the people tailgating me in a bend will soon be left scratching their head as to how they couldn't keep up. The car is very responsive and compared to my other car, which is much newer, has this earthy, mechanical feel to it that takes me back to my teenage years. Superb handling, great clutch feel, low insurance, awesome looks, good/great fuel economy and just the rarity of these means that you won't pass yourself on the road. Many people have never seen this model where I live so you can chalk up exclusivity to the pros. The only negative I have is the lack of room in the engine bay. Luckily, the car is reliable, so it's no biggie as the big job waterpump/timing belt has already been completed. In the meantime, I'll keep enjoying this ""drivers car"".  Civics and Corollas are great cars, but why drive them when you can drive this for the price of that.",1
Great car,1
Best truck ever.,1
I like my mustang,1
"This is a big vehicle.  The trunk is cavernous, the back seat expansive with ample leg room, and the front seat leg room is deep.  The hip room in front is a bit tight because of the size of the center console.  The driving position can seem low at first, but the Limited's infinite power seat positions allow you to raise the height and adjust the back to whatever is most comfortable.  The electronic safety equipment is amazing; BLIS, frontal crash avoidance, lane positioning, and others are state-of-the-art.  The MyFord interface takes time to learn, but once understood it is easy to operate.  Even the remote start operation is great.  It turns on the steering wheel heater and driver seat heat automatically in the winter, as well as the front and rear defrosters.  The engine gives you enough pop to launch onto a highway entrance or during a lane change to instill confidence.  It does sound raspy during acceleration, but is very quiet at highway speeds.  In fact the car is remarkably quiet on the road.  The ride is superb.",1
"Got mine used with 75,000 miles. I've had it since 2004 and now have over 230,000 miles on it. A few repairs for this work horse, but just the normal things on an older car, nothing major or not fixable. Great SUV. Very comfortable in the LS model. Love it! Will drive it until it becomes more expensive to repair it than to get a newer vehicle. If I won Lotto, I'd spend a few thousand to spruce her up a bit. That's how much I love this vehicle.",1
Good automobile,1
This car is not for race but is simply the best.,1
"I have owned this car for 9 years now and the odometer is sitting at 196k miles and I've never had to have been towed or sit on the side of the road and this car has a good balance of all the key aspects I look for in a car.

Overview:
It is powerful enough to handle aggressive traffic here in Texas where speed limits range between 70-85 on freeways. It also gets great gas mileage for the power(V6), 27 city driving but on road trips will average 34 freeway mileage(at 70-90 mph). And for a 2006 year model car, has standard features that even 2017 model cars don't have. I love my remote start 

Mechanical:
I have had to do some work on the car, but very little;
Replaced the Rear shock absorbers and front struts
Spark Plugs
Fuel Level Sensor
Alternator
Coolant Thermostat Sensor

Overall, I love this car. I have changed out the original stereo unit to a touchscreen unit, added Infinity Kappa speakers inside with a 4CH amplifier. I also put in a couple 12"" Infinity Kappa subwoofers with monoblock amplifier(1 OHM ) which is what I think finally killed my original factory alternator after 8.5 years.

Bottom line, I drive this car every day and enjoy it today as I did 9 years ago if not more. I go to look at new cars at dealerships and it's hard to find anything I would call a full upgrade. I have no intention of ever trading this car in and hope to see this car make it another 200k miles.",1
"Great car!
AWD is awesome this hugs the road in the dry and is amazing in the snow
We have own our 2001 25rs for 16 years now and will probably buy a new WRX
But we are keeping the rs",1
I think it is the best car on the same category on the road. It saved my life on a trip to New York. Never had a problem with it since I had it.,1
Wonderful car.  Rides like a dream.  We have a FWD only and it handles the northern Michigan snows great.  Better than our previous vehicles by far.  Nearing 70k miles with no problems whatsoever.,1
"We have had this truck since 2005, and never let us down. We are lifelong GM customers and this truck is still going strong!!!",1
"Solid car.  A pleasure to drive.  Easy to work on.  Rear-Wheel drive gives this heavy car a sports-car feel.  Clich, but it's true... they don't make em' like these anymore!  With clean fluids and the proper maintenance, I'm realistically expecting 500K+ miles from this fine vehicle.",1
Literally the best car ever!!!!!!!!!  if i won the lottery i would just update a few things and keep this car forever!,1
"It would be 5 stsrs if the stinking check engine light would quit coming on,,same code,,replace cat.converters,,i have replaced them twice in two years,,light is on right now",1
I have this truck for 26 years! It's great!,1
"Very reliable car, never had any problems, still starts right up and still runs like it's brand new.",1
"I purchased the truck new in 1998, at Golden State Ford, L.A. Ca. It now has 361,000 Mi. to date the heads or valve covers have not been removed. The Transmission was rebuilt at 280,000Mi. It still does not burn oil, has plenty power, was briefly used to tow a 40 Ft. trailer. And Ford made that 7.3 better I don't think so. Thanks International.",1
Excellent car,1
"This car has been insanely reliable. Ive only ever been left somewhere once and it was when my original clutch gave out at 180,000 miles, well beyond when they typically give out. Beyond that Ive always kept up on preventative maintenance and have never even seen an engine light unless I knowingly let something go longer than recommended (catalytic converter). These cars are peppy, get decent gas mileage, and still don't look very old at all when kept in good shape. I wouldnt have chosen a different car if I could go back in time, its treated me very well. Also, on top of it all there are many interchangeable parts between the 7th gen accord and other Hondas / Acuras. I have a TSX I take manifold, TL rear sway bar, 7th Gen V6 6spd strut bar and front brakes / rotors as well as prelude wheels, now it feels even peppier than before and looks sharp, all direct bolt one. Also, Id recommend the Injen SRI for this car, its sounds incredible and with the TSX manifold really opens up the engine for some better torque.",1
Love this truck,1
"I've had great luck with my 2002 Tundra. Currently just over 70K miles and I do regular oil changes and all service required by Toyota. Mine doesn't look really great because it is not kept in a garage or even covered, so the sun and weather have taken a toll. I've been looking a new pickups, but it is hard for me to justify when the Tundra runs & drives so well and gets about 17 MPG in all-around driving! I'll probably drive it for a few more years.",1
"BEST DESIGN EVER BEAUTIFUL BODY INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR,EXCELLENT ENGINE LOOKS.THE CAR LOOKS GREAT",1
Fit perfect on my dad 1999 Tacoma,1
Great Truck. Comfortable on long trips and perfect for hauling the quads.,1
"EXL V6 Coupe, it is driving peace of mind !",1
Absolutely enjoy my G-35. Already looking to purchase a second Infiniti but maybe the QX-60 This time.,1
"What a great truck! rugged, big and heavy! This may not be for you if you are looking for something to just drive around in comfort in. While it is a really comfortable truck with lots of room in the cab, comfortable seating and a nicely laid out interior, its got a very stiff ride and you'll feel every bump in the road due to its being a HD truck with really heavy suspension, but Loaded down with wood, rocks, dirt or anything else, it rides like a Cadillac!!!
Talk about tuff, It will tow a house, yank any ford or dodge from the mud or snow, Tug a boat or haul whatever you can fit in the bed or tie to the tail hitch! and it will love every minute of it!
Mine is loaded, Black with black leather interior, and its a real head turner when its all cleaned up and buffed out and shiny!  I recently got hit pretty hard in the nose when a semi ran a stop sign in a snow storm, $11,000.00 worth of damage but the INS. company didn't ""total"" it because of its holding its book value rather well... and its a 2012!  So almost 1 month and almost a whole new nose later, you'd never know she got hit! I love this beast, best truck I have owned yet, beating out the Chevy Silverado I bought new back in 1988!",1
I have had my car for almost two years and have thoroughly enjoyed driving it.  I always have a good feeling when I get in to drive somewhere.  This is worth the extra money.,1
Good parts for good price,1
"I've only owned this car for a month, but so far I am in love with it. It drives and handles great. The tech and engine compartment seems easier to access and make minor repairs and maintenance on. A lot more room than my previous Scion XD. The previous owner took really good care of it so it's clean as a whistle and handles beautifully. Really enjoy this car. Especially the cargo room and AWD that allows me to go places my smaller hatch back couldn't.",1
"These trucks have a cult following and I always get waves and thumbs up when I drive it around.  This truck is my daily driver and I love the way it drives like a truck. Manual steering, brakes, clutch, transmission, everything.  Easy to work on, plenty of parts available.",1
I bought this truck in 1999 and it's still running smoothly! I've had body work done on it and it looks brand new. I love my truck!!,1
"Just turned 214,000 miles and would not get a different vehicle!  When this one dies I will get another, As others have said it is not been the most reliable of all cars I have not owned it has far not been the least! But a SUV or rather a SAV! But runs and handles like a sports car! what more could you ask for? I have always had American Muscle cars this may lack about 100hp,  but it handles as well or better than any Trans Am, Camaro or Mustang I've owned and I can still get lumber or my table saw in the back and go anywhere in the Wi winter. This vehicle the the first and second places in the 2004 Alcan 5000 Winter rally in basic stock form against other rally vehicles, that gives you a clue as to how great of a job this does in the snow and winter performance and its driving capabilities. Great job BMW!!!!!!",1
"I own a 2000 tahoe, same as the 99.  Bought it new.  Awesome vehicle.  Like it so much, I bought a new one a couple of years ago.",1
2013 cadillac Escalade Hybrid Platinum.. Really happy with this purchase. Look really nice and rides counfy.,1
"My 1999 Tacoma 4x4 TRD ext cab is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  A few limitations in the small size of the gas tank vs. the way it really burns gas makes me worry about driving on long road trips.  Now, I read where others have 200,000+ miles on their trucks and even more and it still keeps chugging along.  Well, my Tacoma just now rolled over at 51,000 miles.  I'm not one to go out much and it amazes me how much I have truly babied this truck over the years.  I want it to last forever.  And, at this rate, it probably will.",1
"It was love at first sight when I saw my first cube in a print ad back in 2008. I purchased my cube in 2011. It's a great car. Very reliable and fun to drive.
The best part of a cube is the interior. Its beautiful and modern with plush chair height seating.
I have had 5 years and I still love my box",1
"Best car I ever owned. Nearly 275,000 miles on a carefully maintained car. This car has never broken down on the road. It has been extremely reliable, gets reasonable gas mileage, better than 30 MPG on the road, around 24 in town driving. At 13 years old, still handles well, no rattles or noises.",1
Great car....just keeps on going.,1
"I have owned 5, from base to full JCW. Very reliable, more fun than should be allowed. If a home is who you are, your car is who you want to be. I'm a big guy, and to feel light and nimble transcends most experiences. This particular model had been no trouble, with 113k the average fuel economy is 43 mpg.",1
Best entry level sports car for the price. Endless modification and tuning options.,1
Mine is a 2012 - First car I ever kept this long and now has over 100k miles on it. Done some repairs but nothing you wouldn't expect. Amazingly comfortable with lots of get up and go. Used to tow 8 foot gated trailers and you do notice a mileage difference when towing but performance is still there where it counts. Love this car a lot.,1
Love this car!,1
137K miles and still running great.  Very few maintenance issues and low cost to make repairs.  This truck has been one of my best purchases.,1
"I bought this car with 100,000 miles on it in 2007 from a Nissan dealer for 12,000. Absolutely the best vehicle I have ever owned. It has 217,000 miles on it now. I replaced the radiator as a precaution because if they fail you loose your transmission. The left front lower ball joint failed at 185,000 miles and the wheel fell off. Replaced both lowers and drive shaft at that time. Brakes replaced 3 times.tires twice. Original alternator lasted 180,000 miles! Michelin is the way to go on tires. Just recently replaced the timing belt,water pump, thermostat because it was time to do it, not because it failed.  Tuned it up at 190,000, wires and plugs. Quiet,responsive,dependable. Best car ever made!",1
"Love this vehicle! Rating companies complain that it is unreliable. I say ""It's a Jeep! Yes some things fail but again  ""It's a Jeep! The great thing is it's a pleasure to work on. Most everything is bolt on bolt off. Plus it has such a huge aftermarket that most replacement parts are relatively inexpensive. Add the fact that it is a blast to drive especially with the top down, tow-able with four wheels on the ground (just put it in neutral and go), and holds it's value (mine is worth more than I paid for it). I wouldn't part with mine for anything!!",1

"I love my 2016 Scat Pack Challenger.  I just crossed the 15000 mile mark and have had no problems except for the blind spots and the initial getting used to the gas pedal touchiness.  It has been an honor to drive my dream down the road daily.  I get 24-26 mpg and can smoke almost anything that gets in my way.  I recommend a good radar detector/scrambler, as it has saved my bacon more than once.  Other than that I'll catch you all in my rearview mirror!",1
"After looking at all the trucks in this segment, the Ridgeline was definitely the best choice for me.  I'm 6'5"" and the cab is much wider and roomier inside than the others. The Ridgeline also rides much nicer than all the rest. On a recent 2400 mile road trip I averaged 26mpg with it as well.",1
Love my car,1

Zero recalls. And no warranty repairs!",1
"Volvo builds a fine automobile.
I drove my '02 V70 XC for over a decade and now my oldest daughter is driving it daily.
This series is known for transmission problems. I solved all of my transmission problems by switching to Amsoil Signature ATF. I've seen people replace their transmissions because of the same issues that Amsoil ATF solved for me.
Electronics can be an issue. Word of warning: disconnect the battery before even touching anything electronic. The rearview mirror has a computer in it (security system).

Randomly pulling fuses can screw things up. Check your fuses with a multimeter on the metal tabs on top of the fuses. Do not remove.

On and on. These cars require understanding of automotive technology.

Nonetheless, fine automobiles.",1
"I purchased my Cruiser new in Jan. 99 and I still drive it today - it is the type of vehicle I can't get rid of. These are in a class all by themselves and the finest vehicle I have ever owned. I've had one repair in 150,000 miles (other than normal maintenance) that costed me $140. On a road trip, it rules. It rolls through the Rocky Mountains, across the desert and in heavy city traffic. Comfortable leather seats that still look great.",1

"Super reliable awesome car. I have had several Honda automobiles with minimal issues. I have had this car since it had 19018 miles. Was my company car 03-08 then purchased it from company. I drive it to Florida every year from Tennessee for vacation and my wife drives the Honda Odyssey. Just had a starter replaced this week. Had new alternator replaced last year. The car just keeps on going. If the Honda CRV is offered in a hybrid in a few years like the Accord is now I would finally give up my Accord and purchase the CRV. Thanks Honda for making such great cars!

So who knows where I'll go from here, but I love my 2007 Crossfire!",1

Still running great after 17 years.,1
"What is not to like with a big truck like this, can't wait to hook up my camper and get away and see how this big boy can run. As for the motor and trans some say it is not as good as they would have liked, but then comes the huge question (What were you looking for?) any 3500 hd truck ""IS A TRUCK"" not a Honda or caddy (although with the Denali package in mine a caddy is not far from this big boy, and i can tow and carry a lot more than any Honda can.
So do i like my 3500 hd Denali you bet i do like i stated above can't wait to get the rv hooked up and hit the highway",1
Awesome truck and very nice,1
"Love this car, my daughter is presently the driver of this great little car. Our Accord happens to be the two door coupe. Always enjoyed the sporty nature of this car, daughter says the same.

"every year since i've had it i've had at least 2 people a year asking if i wanted to sell it.  i've said no every time.  it's paid for, over 6 years old and in stock form can take on the 3-diamond trails with ease which is all the daredevilishness i need.  I plan on driving it until the wheels fall off which should be another 15 years or so at this pace",1
Exelent,1
"This is a great ride, smooth and roomy with all the power you'll need. Plenty of room for six with the center console pulled up. The only draw back maybe the Northstar engine which developed a water jacket crack and coolant leak at 137,000 miles. Replacing the engine and having the transmission overhauled will insure that I have a dependable ride for many miles. I got the car from a friend because he couldn't see it go to junk yard (it was in great shape i.e. body and leather interior). It was well worth the time and expensive to bring this one back to life.",1
"Bought it used for a song four years ago, have put 100,000 miles on it. Small annoying repairs like broken track on driver's window, bearings or whatever. Now at 185k m, and just love driving it. Would buy another '04 when it hits 300k.",1
Best on the road all around.,1
"This is a great car. I've had mine for over 20 years without any engine or transmission issues. It's still fun to drive, very reliable, and easy to work on.",1
"Ditto to everything that the other reviewers have said. The car seems like it is from the future.

Admittedly, if you thought you were buying an ultra luxury vehicle (which at this price point would not be an unreasonable thought) you might be somewhat disappointed. Some of the things in the cabin don't make a ton of sense. No cupholders in the back seat. The center console is easy to lose things in (some places where things can slip are difficult to retrieve from).

But that is all completely dwarfed by the experience of driving the vehicle. The power that is at your control is amazing. The intuitive tools and the autopilot make it an entirely new experience to drive this car.

It shows what a company can do if they don't have 100 years of legacy to protect. Ford, GM, Honda, etc have to iterate their product line so they don't leave old customers disappointed. Tesla got to start from a blank slate and they did an incredible job.

The fact that they run the company more like a tech company than a car company is a major shift. My car updates itself with new features whenever they are available. That is unheard of to date from the legacy car manufacturers.",1
"I got mine from my grandpa when he quit driving after a wreck. He gave it to me to fix. Parts are abundant, and usually reasonably priced, and there one of the simplest modern trucks to work on. I have no true mechanical skill but if I need to change a part I consult the Internet and YouTube and usually find my answer.",1
"Mine was a non-power steering standard (manual) transmission with crank-operated windows. Most smiles per gallon of any car. Perfect for summer weather, still handled winter snows with grace, everything can be fixed with a 10mm wrench, parts are cheap and interchangeable with some Ford and Kia cars (Kia parts are the same part number but half the price sometimes). Rear wheel drive and perfect balance, with a lightweight flywheel in mine to give it some extra pep. Still have it but I'm going to sell it, as I've just bought a 1997 Miata. (: Poor man's sports car, and it gets a lot of attention on the road.",1
"""Jukee"", she's the best.  Drove her from Hueytown, Alabama (south of Birmingham), to Catoosa, Oklahoma and followed Route 66 all the way to Santa Monica, California; up the west cost into Oregon, back across I-80 then from Lincoln, Nebraska to Dallas, Texas; next I-20 from Dallas back home again.  Three-weeks and what a wonderful ride.  Again, She's the BEST!!",1
"I bought this car with 23k miles on it after it was leased for 3 years. I have since put more than 180k miles on it and it still runs like a champ even when I have neglected it's maintenance. This has been my first and only car, and I don't see myself ever owning another.",1
I like the turbo braking capabilities while towing my camper and also makes a pretty good daily driver.,1
This is the car that Toyota's reputation is built upon. The V6 version is a beast that just keeps running and considering is age I couldn't be more pleased.,1
"great little car and no major breakdowns, paint damage from sun and tree sap the only things that bother me on it but thats not on toyota. Would buy another one without hesitation. 150K miles and counting.",1
"Pros:
Very good power
Shifts up and down in a ""smart"" fashion
Suspension provides a nice ride
Bed rail securing system is adjustable and handy
Oil and filter change is easy

Cons:
Seat sits way too low and lumbar adjustment is a joke
Headrest only goes up and down, but points forward into back of your head
To sit up straight your vision will be close to the roofline, making visibility difficult
Road noise

I love my truck and fortunately I only work 5 minutes from home. If you are over 5'10"" and travel a lot I would NOT recommend this truck.",1

Excellent Pick up,1
Great quality replacement and choice of colors.,1
"This has to be the best car we've owned, bought new in 2012 and the only thing its been in the shop for is oil changes and a update to the ECM. The Tiguan is a pleasure to drive and very comfortable, the average fuel mileage has been 25.2mpg . We have a keeper.  C.T.Heilman",1
"Plus side:
- fantastic work on the ride and suspensions: super comfy, no roll, yet a dynamic ride.
- silent
- dashboard is beautiful
- tons of leg room in 2 row if not using the 3rd
- super gearbox, petrol engine very at ease

Down side:
- no storage space inside
- no trunk cover (WTF?)
- radio turns on everytime you get in the car (why???)
- no diesel in the US
- boot could be taller

Overall it drives beautifully, it's very very good for long road trips. For practicality, go for a land cruiser, for confort and driver pleasure, go for it.",1

"I have owned my 1998 Ford Windstar for about 7 or 8 years now, I still love it!  so roomy and comfortable, it has been such a reliable vehicle Ive always been leery of trading it in on anything else, in all these years all Ive had to do to it is put in a fuel pump. other than that, no problems,  I never want to be without it! I will drive this car till its no longer drivable.",1
The restyling for 2015 was timid on the outside but inside its a whole new car. Tons of amazing electronics. The dash the interior everything is so far forward from the 2014 and back. I went with an r\t and have zero regrets. You will not regret your purchase trust me.,1
"I love this truck. Still have it and drive it everyday. Great truck! Comfortable, powerful and best looking truck by far! Take care of your truck, it'll last for a long time. My friend has one with 390,000 miles and still runs great",1
This is the best truck Chevrolet has ever built! Thats why they brought it back!! It's a SUV with the capacity to haul anything!!!,1
"Been pleasantly surprised by the reliability of this vehicle. I use my van for family commuting as well as a work vehicle for my installation company. It currently has 126,000 or so miles. Routine oil changes every 5000 miles, new rims/tires, lowering suspension, and a front wheel bearing has keep it going strong as my daily driver.",1
Nothing beats a Ford.,1
It has been a very good truck.,1
"Best truck I've ever owned. At 234K miles it still runs strong, everything is original on this truck.",1
Most dependable truck Ive ever owned so I bought another for the wife,1
My truck is almost four years old and I haven't experiences any problems.,1
"Great vehicle, overall very satisfied with its reliability great looks, easy to clean interior, powerful engine, fun to drive, comfortable seat. This vehicle will take you anywhere!",1
Everything good,1
We love our Hyundai Tuscan,1
I love the car 06 hemi more then I do my new truck anyone no why the car lights sometimes flicker off n on and shutting off while driving n yet still runs ?,1
Fantastic truck.  The 57:43 weight ratio means it drives amazingly well for a pickup.  Stabilitrac and the 4x4 system are amazing.  This canyon sticks to the ground like a tank.  Payload is exceptional.  Tows very confidently and seats are comfy.  The iPod interface is cute but the software needs help.  My iPod library overloads the system and causes crashing,1
"Not bad good on gas, works down street!.",1
"I owned my Pontiac Grand Prix SE (2.1 L) car for 20 years and had put 239,000 miles on it. It received regular maintenance but was not garaged. I averaged 22 mi/gal in town and 30 mi/gal on the highway. It was a very reliable vehicle. My only complaint was that the doors would sometimes freeze shut because of winter precipitation.",1
Great car enjoy everytime I drive it,1
"Great little van. I call it my ""dad van"". I find that it's a quick little car, and I've not had too much trouble. I'm having to replace a good deal of the suspension at 110k miles, but I don't think that's unexpected. Overall, the Mazda's been easy to work on as well, and I get better mileage than the EPA sticker says. I have to admit that the road noise had always been a weak point, however.",1
What I like about this is that you can purchase a variety of items to make your Jeep a better vehicle. This is what I have done with mine. The Jeep design hasn't changed much love it.,1
"Purchased new, currently 226,000 miles. Original brakes, 6.0 v-8 gas motor , normal part replacement. Last truck I will buy.",1
Best truck i ever owned,1
"Great ride and great gas mileage for this type of car (25mpg hwy). Currently at 163,000 miles and likely to keep going.",1
I don't think there's any other vehicle better than this! This is our fourth Range Rover and the only complaint I can see is that we can't get the garage door to work with the remote in the rearview mayor but it is most likely are older garage door opener and not the Rover's problem. I Feel very safe in it. We just traded our BMW X6 for this because we want to pull a trailer and go camping with our family and our BMW would only haul half of the weight that this will.,1
"I love my Yukon XL Denali! It's spacious, easy to park, and if serviced correctly is very reliable and long lasting. I really enjoy the height of the vehicle, because my children can climb in and out on their own, and when I'm putting My baby in I don't have to bend and strain my back, because the seats at standing level.",1
"Ram 1500 sport. Love it. The hemi is powerful and run to drive. The heated and cooled leather seats are awesome. I love the heated steering wheel. The navigation is so so. Backup camera is awesome and the screen is huge. Sound system is incredible and does not sound like a factory setup. Overall I give this vehicle a top score because it does it all. The crew can provides plenty of leg room for adults in the back, and it does very well. I am very happy I purchased this truck.",1
If you keep up whit oil change and add new water pump 8 to 10 year. It good truck,1
"Enjoyable car, decent performance, great value. With the availability of upgrade parts this is an excellent car to have some fun with!",1
"Had it since 2006, only issue was I replaces one coil.  Now has 130,000 miles and is running strong",1
"My 2006 is the best ""new car"" I've ever had.  Simple, not a lot of gimmicks that can cost thousands to fix. Plenty of power (but no Ferrari). 11 years and 122,000 miles. My husband takes great care of her, but Amazon won't let me tell you how other than regular maintenance, 3,000 miles oil/filter changes and the like. Comfortable, one of the last cars to have great window vision all around. I'd buy another if it was -0- miles new.",1
Awesome vehicle with a smooth ride and superb milage.,1
Best car I've ever owned 250 K and 200 K more to go!,1
Awesome truck,1
"362000Miles, original transmission, engine, radiator. No repairs, still running great !!!!
Just a great little car.",1
"This is my 5th Ford pickup and it is the best. Quiet, powerful and well made. I ordered this from the factory after building it on their web site.
Truck was delivered in five weeks.",1
"I just bought my third F150 Lariat Supercrew with the 3,5 ecoboost. I put 147,000 miles on the last one without a single mechanical failure. I get great gas mileage for a full sized truck. It pulls my fiberglass bass boat and 16 ft. utility trailer loaded with ATV's with ease. It does everything well and is roomy and comfortable. I have had the 5.4 liter V8 in a 2007 and 2010 F150. The eco-boost doesn't sound as good, but I will take the performance and gas mileage over the V8's any day.",1
Great fun truck!  43k original miles.  327 v8 runs perfect.  Turbo 400 tranny shifts great.  411 gear Dana 60 diff a bit to low gear ratio fo freeway driving.  Would change to a higher ratio.  Power steering and brakes and air all original. New awesome sounding exhaust.,1
Because the parts fit perfectly and my truck looks very cool with the parts on it .,1
"1993 Corvette, manual transmission
Currently, the price on these cars are very affordable, and as a 21 year old, driving a Corvette has been my dream. It's by no means the faster car, the most high tech car (for being 1993, this car was very high tech for the time), nor is it the best looking Corvette, in my opinion. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Of course there will be issues, but these cars are over 20 years old! It is still a fun, fast car and I always get looks wherever I go. Just don't forget that if you have one of these (or any Corvette) don't forget to wave at fellow Corvette drivers!",1
So far everything has been great with the car. Bought 6 months ago. The only problem i have so far is a air vent has falling out of the dash. Not sure why. But it's should be easy to fix.,1
I inherited my 96 Tahoe when my stepfather passed away. He kept it in pristine condition and I love it. It runs like a top.,1
The scat pack is a beast. Every option you can get just needs wider tires.,1
"I have a 2007 new body style Silverado. Crew Cab. 4x4. I currently have 98,000 miles on it and it runs great. It has the 4.8 engine and still has plenty of power for normal use and getting in the mud. I recommend this truck to anybody for a everyday use. If you haul heavy loads get the Duramax. Only flaw is it likes to burn gas! But I'll pay for gas bc it's an awesome truck and great ride. I have 285/70/17 Toyo open country and still a very smooth ride. Overall Great Truck!!!",1
"My wife bought this car new in 2013 and has had ZERO concerns. She has owned four Jettas now, and Im sure she will buy another one in a few years. Car is very solid and drives and rides like a much more expensive car. Fit and finish is also better than most cars in that price range. Ive always been an advocate for buying American, but its hard to argue the quality of these cars.",1
"I've had this vehicle since 2002. I has been so good that I find it hard to part with. I have been in the market for a new car over 2 years. But, I have yet to test drive anything which can compare to the 1997 Buick Regal! The way this car handles ""herself""  a.k.a Ms. Re Gal, on the open road is priceless! When I need her to get out of harms way in a pinch, WOW! She has 140.000 miles and still going strong. I was told about a year ago that the transmission is about to kill over. However, I've actually gone on a long distance trip with Ms. Re Gal and as always, she did the job!  As a new car shopper, I wish I could clone Ms. Re Gal and be done with it!",1
Nothing bad to say fit great very easy to put on looks great .,1
"SS Sedan = low cost daily fun.
I'm a lot like Ricky Bobby: I wanna go fast. This car is an inexpensive way to experience great performance every day. Thanks to its 2.0 L turbocharged engine, Brembo brakes, light curb weight, 5 speed manual transmission, and limited slip differential, this car goes, stops, and turns like a much more expensive performance car. Because it's a Chevy, the cost of ownership is low as parts and maintenance are reasonably priced, and fuel economy is decent (I average 29 mpg in mixed city/highway driving). The trade off is, well.....the Cobalt is a Chevy economy car. The interior, while being simple and functional, uses the cheapest plastics available. ""No frills, basic functionality"" is the appropriate description for the interior. The Recaro seats are the one indulgence inside.
I purchased my SS 2 years ago with low miles at a bargain price and have been very pleased. I'd highly recommend this car for a frugal individual who enjoys spirited driving and who doesn't mind living without all the gadgetry found in newer cars.",1
Awesome,1
This truck has served me well through 277K miles so far. You can't beat a Toyota engine.,1
I like this car,1
"A perfect all-around vehicle for Hawaii. Roomy, comfortable and competent on and off-road. Absolutely trouble-free and time-less design. Never looks dated.",1
Loving it. No more word I can say,1
"On its launch, the 240Z was a spectacular car that could easily compete with the best cars from the American and European market. It was a performance car with a sexy look, at a price (only $3500) that helped the maker to sell over 30,000 units in 1971 and over 50,000 and 40,000 in 1972 and 1973, respectively..

The 240Z came in two different versions: one for the American market and one for the Japanese one. The one for the Japanese market was more design into race, while the American model had nothing of a race car in it. It was powered by a SOHC L20 Inline-6 engine with an output of 130 hp, and on the American market came with L24 Inline-6 engine with twin SU carburetors that produced 151 hp.

The exterior styling was inspired by the Ferrari GTO proportions and the Jaguar E-type nose. Nissan also added delicate bumper and framed by headlights recessed into ice scoop buckets mounted in the front fenders. It had a weight of 2320 lbs.

A true sports car with a retro look, the first-series Z-Cars were a real success on the market. Next with its performance, quite good at that time, there was the price, with no other competition on the market, reason why the vehicle an icon of 70s cool and sophistication. As seen from the statistics, Nissan knew how to have a word to say on the market. They knew their customers desires and find solutions to create a car at a price that every one could afford to buy it. And as the history will show, the Z-Cars were and are a big hit on all over world.

Nissans sports cars always been a success on the Japanese market and not only. So is the Nissan Fairlady Z (name used in Japan) starting its first year of unveiling in 1970 until our days. The Fairlady Z was sold on the US market as Datsuns until 1984. The first model from the Z-Cars series was the 240Z. Next Nissan presented the 260Z, 280Z, 280ZX, 300ZX and last one is 350Z. The Datsuns 240Z was unveiled in 1969 and on the US market was brought in 1970 by Yutaka Katayama, president of Nissan Motors USA operations.",1
Perfect fit,1
All they say it is. Only 1300 miles so can only base review on that.,1
Very pleased with my car. Only issue Ive had is the key sometimes won't turn when starting. Just have to jiggle it a bit.,1
I love this car. I have it for about 21 years and I have no problems with it,1
"Outside of regular maintenance and tires we have not had to spend money on this vehicle, it's very reliable. It is however not very comfortable especially for long road trips. More of a good commuter vehicle.",1
My 2500 HD Crewcab has been an excellent vehicle. I have not had any major problems with this truck. I have owned it for 12 years and other than tire and brakes and a couple of brake lines I have not had any difficulties with it. Gas mileage could be a little better but it is expected of a heavy duty vehicle.,1
My dream car!!!,1
"Great truck! Use it to tow boats and equipment trailer. Backup camera was great, but a disaster to keep working. Going after market for a backup camera.",1
"Best car I have ever owned!
I have owned another 2007 gt
And a 2006 gt",1
"Great price, fast ship, good parts",1
"Best track I've ever owned,  and longest I've kept a vehicle.  Still runs like new",1
"It's a great ride:  Comfortable, powerful, can tow a trailer with ease, gets surprisingly good mileage on the road (21-22mph)",1
"Great truck 312,000 miles and rolling only had to rebuild transmission as only major problem.",1
Works perfect,1
Everything about his car was awesome. The only problem I see is that my mpg is tapering odds own to around 41mpg. I've tried engine air filter and tire pressure.  It may be the tires i got from Sams club but still more than happy.,1
Great fit and price,1
I have owned this car for 23 years! I love the hell out of her!! Absolutely the best car I have ever owned!,1
"My 06 Duramax 6 spead Allison is a great all around work truck when its done working it pulls a10,000 pound boat to and from the lake for fun the only issue I have is the lack of turning radius at over 230,000 miles I still cant find another one for parts at any bone yard",1
Have had this truck twelve years this month. So far I've had to replace the instrument package but GM is noted for this. One battery and tires. Very satisfied.,1
Love my Chevrolet Avalanche it is a great ride my wife loves it too and also my Family I  command you guys get one they have a 5 seater and a 6 seater love my ride,1
"My 2005 V6 4x4 Toyota Tacoma is still going strong after 185,000 miles. With regular maintenance, I can say that it still runs like the day I bought it new. Over the years I've had to replace a few parts such as an A/C compressor and maybe a water pump that was showing age, but overall it has performed very well and still starts easily even in the winter. I have used the truck for hauling fairly heavy loads many times and it has always done great. It drives well at highway speeds as well as in the deep snow or on a sandy beach. The truck has had a few recalls over the years, but Toyota has been good about repairing them without any fuss. The headlight lenses slowly fogged over due to the ice melting chemicals they use here in CO, but I was able to install replacement headlight assemblies in less than 90 minutes, so DYI folks can do some work/customizing on these trucks themselves with relative ease. For a short time I had regular road tires on the truck and it got a respectable 22mpg on the highway... not so much with the bigger tires. If I had to say any negatives about the truck it would have to be the radio volume control, which has become sluggish with age. Seriously, that's it. I always say the two most reliable things in my life are my wife and my Taco.",1
My Chevy 2500hd classic is a fire breathing dragon . If you mess with big truck he will eat your dreams and poop out unicorns ,1
"I have enjoyed this car ever since I got it. At that time the mileage was pretty good but newer cars now have better mileage. Even so, the only repairs I have needed in all of the time I've had this car has been to replace the radiator,  and take care of wear and tear items. It has been dependable and comfortable.  As preventive measure right now, I am planning to replace the timing belt. I think I have saved so much money over the years that I have owned this car that the 24 mpg  I currently get is still quite reasonable.",1
"Excellent vehicle!!!! Unfortunately, for me my Daughter totaled it out.",1
"My husband is happy with this purchase,it was delivered fast.",1
Love this car!,1
"I loved my First Subaru so much, I just bought my second. The car safety features are great , not to mention the set up for family fun and outdoors capabilities. I also had a bike rack installed on the back. The space and handling of the Subaru are perfect for me my driver and my dogs. I love the vehicle and that the company is so into communities and helping. Thank you Subaru for supporting Leader Dogs for the Blind.",1
"Jeeps are for men not people who cant handle it, buy yourself a moped!",1
"While the 79 F100 was made to fit new federal emissions guidelines at the time, the truck is still a great vehicle and with careful research you can find ways to drastically improve its power, mileage, and efficiency.",1
"2013 Grand Sport Convertible. Night Race Blue Metallic, with deep red GS stripes over the left fender. The last of the C6 body style with more sexy curves and muscles than the chiseled lines of the C7. 436 hp/450 lbs torque. Destined to be a true classic and collectible. Still draws looks and smiles despite the more dramatic C7.",1

Luv.... luv my XTS!  & it luv me back!  Offering me a luxurious ride with amazing driving performance!!,1
good fit and super fast shipping,1
"Camry Hybrid gets 39 to 40 mpg as advertised. Nice fairly quiet ride. Extremely reliable, low maintenance.",1
Quiet and very comfortable.,1
More to life than mpg. Fastest most reliable truck out there. More room than you can use inside. Ive wanted one for years and finally bought a lifted 04 last year. Just regeared it for the tires and locked it. Things a monster.,1
Best car for the recreational minded ! We bought this car while living in Montana because it had the highest safety rating.  What we didn't know is how well it handles the road in snowy weather. It can handle our kayaks and other gear very nicely. Thank you Subaru !,1
"AMC 4.0L 6cylinder is a very good engine. Currently at 200,000, no major issues. Great daily driver. Gas milage approx. 20mpg,",1
I bought my 08 Gran Marquis new in 08 and I still have it. It's still in showroom condition. I work at a Ford dealership so I'm able to upkeep all aspects of the car. As far as the comfort and performance you can't beat it . I enjoy my car every day. Anyone in the market for one of these cars should go for it. You won't regret it.,1
thermostat fit perfect,1
"So far, so good! Really impressed, didn't think I would be. Replaced a '08 Titan I had for 9 years. Loved that truck, but new ones (turbo diesel, which I don't need) are deep into the $50k's. Got the V6 since I don't haul anything to speak of, and drive it to work. OMG is it quiet and smooth, but then again replacing a 9 you truck with 130k miles, it had better be. Miss a lot of the usable features Nissan had 9 years ago (power rear window , etc), but Chevy makes up with modern electronic items. We'll  see if they last.  9 years and no rust in upstate NY, really good with winters and salt (you have no clue how much unless you live here!). I had it undercoated and rust proofed, hoping it'll help. Great riding truck, well see in snow which it will this weekend and week, and I'm hunting all week. Hope to Christen truck! So far... really impressed.",1
"My last post was for the keys I purchased in this spot for the RAM. Love this truck. Great power, all the options I wanted at a wonderful negotiated price with the dealer. Even got cheaper financing greater the the bank and credit union. No complaints at all.",1
Don't get any better than this.,1
It's my husband car and he absolutely loves it!,1
Awesome truck. LOVE the CTD! Bought used and would totally recommend this truck for towing or whatever you want to do.,1
Met all of my expectations.,1
Best truck I've ever had. But there is always room for improvement,1
Good Truck.,1
"I own a 2014 Grand Cherokee Summit 4x4 with the 5.7L Hemi V8.  It is a joy to drive and handles very well no matter what the road condition might bedry, wet, snowand it is extremely comfortable, more so even than my two previous Lincoln Town Cars.  I even tow a 5000 travel trailer with no problems at all other than, as expected, a significant drop in gas mileage when towing, especially in mountainous areas.  Its the finest vehicle Ive ever owned.",1
"A most reliable truck drives nice pulls trailers like a dream and FWD works when you need it.
Pulled a Land Rover out of a ditch a few weeks ago, my truck never even noticed he was on the rope, he was well stuck in the mud lol.",1
"Great truck, rides and handles very well, best part is I've had no problems with it.",1
"144,000 still great car. I love the ride and its all how you take care of the car. looks like new.",1
Good truck no problems good gas milage,1
"Outstanding Truck, keeps running well and safe with a comfortable ride.  Looks like new and often asked to sale no matter where it's at.  Serviced properly and dependable.",1
Best vehicle I've ever owned!,1
Nice vehicle!!!,1
"This car is a great car, looks good Rodes great .",1
Best truck I ever owned,1
Robbie from weber auto group in silvis Illinois  was the best salesman i ever came across.  I woukd totally  recomend him to family and friends who need a car. He went abobe and beyond for me.,1
"Comfortable, reliable, great road car.  Easy to drive and shockingly quick.  The diesel has 450 lb./ft. of torque which makes it a rocket on the highway.  Will cruise all day at 90+ mph and still get 28 mpg in almost total silence.  You NEVER hear the engine and the double glass windows eliminate all wind noise.  All wheel drive means it is great in snow or the wet.

The only downside is it does have a few squeaks and rattles in the interior...not what you would expect from such a nice car.",1
Excelent! I hightly recomend this purschase!,1
"Great reliable car, economical on gas.",1
Awesome Truck! Minimal maintenance in the 12 years I have had it.,1
"Almost 20 years of loyal service, and a blast to drive!

We've had to change many parts on the car, and swap the engine recently, but she runs beautifully, and is incredibly easy to service at home!",1
Great truck had ford and dodges have always had great luck with the GM trucks,1
What can I say it's a jeep,1
"I have the ZXW wagon and love it. Minimal repairs, lots of space. good mileage.  Sad that they stopped making them.. I would have bought another.",1
I love my truck.,1
"going on 2000,000 miles stll going strong just usll parts ned to be replaced but engine and trany are great",1
"I purchased this car in 2001 when it came back to the dealer at the end of a two-year lease. It had 10K miles when I purchased it; now over 150K. It has a manual transmission. This is nothing more than an Acura-ized Honda Accord. BUT nothing has ever gone wrong with this car. I've schlepped my three kids throughout the state in this car and then when they got older, I taught them how to drive a stick in this car. Even today, when I walk out into the driveway, I know it will start when I turn the key. By today's standards, it's pretty underpowered. I don't think an automatic transmission would have been as much fun as the manual. Paint is still good, no clear coat failure like some of the later model Hondas that I've seen on the road or have purchased for my kids. Air conditioner still works. Sunroof doesn't leak. I keep telling my wife that I'll sell it when the radio goes out, but nothing ever goes out on this car! I've changed the clutch once. I've changed the tires maybe three times. It became my basic commuter beater car that I used to drive to the train station. Now I'm retired, so I use it to now for trips to the grocery store, coffee shop, and to haul my kayak to and from the put-in. Not bad for a two-door coupe!",1
Performance and handling.,1
"I love this car!  I am a Kia fan anyway - I owned a 2008 Sportage prior to my Sorento.  Its roomy, rides smooth and gets really good gas mileage",1
"Truck is awesome, 270,000 mile with very few problems, wish they still made the 7.3 diesel.",1
"It's better than you ever dreamed it was going to be.
Original owner.",1
Highly reliable and such a smooth ride.,1
"Love the style of this Suv good in gas, with good power!!
 I am a big guy and I fit conformable Lots of room for 7. Good family Suv for a good price!!",1
Great car hands down! Not exciting to ride but great gas mileage and extremely reliable !,1
Fit perfect,1
Excellent car.  Would recommend it to anyone.,1
"We purchased our 2008 Honda Odyssey EX-L w/nav & RES with 154,400 miles on it.  It runs like a top, doesn't burn, use or leak any oil.  The ride quality is very good (especially for a 9 year old vehicle with 154,000 miles!).  Transmission shifts smooth and the best part of all, is that you can actually do a lot of maintenance yourself.  You can actually change the spark plugs (very easily) without having to removed wiper motors, etc.  So far it's been a great vehicle and it is 10X nicer than the Chrysler mini-vans we have owned.  Since our youngest is now 4 years old, we'll be looking at a Honda Pilot for our next vehicle.",1
I have the 2016 Explorer Sport and I absolutely love it!!! It's very comfortable for me to drive both in the city and out on the highway. The only drawback is the gas mileage but I've almost always owned a truck so I'm used to poor gas mileage.,1
"Reliable and easy to maintain.  I bought this car used at over 90,000 miles and it still runs great, over 20,000 miles later, with just standard maintenance.  I've gotten more than my money was worth and highly recommend picking one of these up as a used car if you are looking at an in expensive and reliable car, perhaps for a teenager or perhaps as a spare car.  The hatchback also gives a good amount of room for storage.",1
Fast and fun to drive!!,1
"\Still new and is exactly what I needed as a second vehicle.  If it goes 340 thousand miles like my other Ford, we will have something to talk about.",1
"I love this truck. It is Toyota quality, and for anyone who does their own maintenance this is the ticket. To change the spark plugs requires less than 45 minutes and 2 tools. Front brake pads can be changed without having to remove the caliper in about 30 minutes per wheel.",1
"Great truck, no major problems. I had some minor issues with the seat heaters, but the issue was exacerbated by an inept dealership so I can't blame the truck. Ran great, worked great and I traded it in for another Sierra.",1
I like it!,1
Only problem is with paint job other wise it is a very low maintenance  and great running vehicle,1
Best car ever. At 285000 miles and still running great!,1
Great family car.  We love it.,1
"Ive owned my TT since 08.  I use this car as my sunny day ride.  I keep the mileage down and find it to not only be a fun ride that handles great but also a head turner. The maintenance isn't a big cost, in fact it rarely goes to the shop.  Its a fun ride but at 17 years old, certainly not a daily driver.",1
"I really like this truck. Very comfortable to drive, good power and a smooth ride. With over 60,000 miles, I've averaged 18.6 MPG. Very happy with that. I have added various items purchased here on Amazon to personalize it to my likings. They include:
Hella 550 series driving lights, 550 series fog lights mounted to the Westin 37-02275 Black Light Bar. Interior I've made a custom console to house my Uniden BC355N scanner and a Uniden 980 SSB CB Radio with Firestik MKM2 Antenna mounts and Firestik MSN4 scanner antenna and a Firestik FireFly antenna for the CB. I put the rear wheel well liners in since Chevrolet doesn't include them and mud flaps at all four corners by Weather Tech (easy no drill installation).
More to come: putting a Ham Radio in the console and another antenna most likely a tri band. I want to change the stock 20"" rims to 17"" rims with 31"" tires.
Well here is the latest update: 17"" Vision rims added with Falcon tires. A 52"" light bar added on top and a 22"" light bar added below the Hella Driving Lights. Fender Flares replace the mud flaps and a Chrome Locking Gas Door was also added.
More to Come!",1
"This vehicle is totally awesome, worth ever dollar I spend for it rides beautiful and all it safety features for instance this vehicle will not start if the driver door is open or go into gear,and ect.",1
"This car is seriously a great car.  It's no Mercedes, but the ride quality is great, the interior is beautiful, with my Molten Red Leather.  The details are beautiful in it.  I just took a trip about 6 hours away with it and averaged about 33 miles per gallon there and back.  I do have the 100th Anniversary Edition,and this is my 3rd Charger in 8 years.  I love the car....",1
"Great vehicle. We are the original owners and keep it garaged. Currently it only has 30K miles. Aside from normal expected wear and tear items, such as wiper blades, brakes pads, battery and tires etc. we have only had a few other odd items that time took a toll on. We replaced all of the gas struts for the hood and rear lift gate and rear window. Had to change out the brake calipers too. We only drive this vehicle 1K miles a year so given the limited use it has held up very well and still looks factory fresh. Very dependable and very good riding vehicle soon to be a classic...",1
"Good power and fuel economy once you remove all the BS on it
Some components are cheap made",1
"Sweet i can write a review for my favorite vehicle!  I bought it from the original owner with 220k, it now has 241k, a lot of which was off road.  It's 22 years old, most vehicles would be long dead, but this thing is still exceptionally reliable.",1
"We love our truck, great towing capabilities for our 5th wheel.",1
"This truck has been amazing! I bought it new in 2004 and for several years I pulled a 23 ft. travel trailer all over Texas on weekends with no problem. Ive pulled a 30ft. flatbed loaded with metal roofing across the state and a 27 ft. travel trailer after already having over 100,000 miles on the truck and never a problem. In 14 years, the only repair Ive had (other than brake jobs) was to replace the drive shaft after being torn up from a seized U joint. Its still my daily driver, now has 170,000 miles and its never had a tuneup yet. It still runs, looks and sounds like it did the day I bought it. Every time I take it in for maintenance everyone remarks on how they cant believe its 14 years old and still looks new. Numerous people have begged me to sell it to them and I always say, youll have to pry it from my cold dead fingers! In my 53 years on this earth I have owned 27 other vehicles and Im sure this is the last vehicle I will own. Tundra rocks!!",1
I love my car and can't wait until SUZUKI comes back to the States. I want another one PLEASE!!! I have owned 2 before this one.,1

"This is the coming to America car.
It's ride is the best I've ever felt.
It's durable mine has more than 750,000 miles
Gets 28-30 mpg.
And can run on any grease you can thin out with heat....
This is the perfect car",1
Amazing. Fun. Versatile.,1

Maintenance has been minimal and we would buy another to replace it.",1
"Waited 36 years to buy a Mustang. All the kids are now on their own, sort of, and I couldn't afford an airplane. My 2016 Mustang is the best valued coupe available.  It has a well designed interior, second to none looks, and most importantly it is a tuner car and not some computer on wheels you can't tinker with and make your own. Well done Ford.",1
8 year later and the car is in a reliable condition.,1
Fit perfectly.  Took about 45 minutes to install with use of a floor jack.,1
"This is one of the most reliable, low maintenance vehicle that I ever owned. 120,000 miles and still going strong. We use this car for all major trips and my wife uses it for her business.",1

"Had this truck 18 yrs and still going strong. I've hauled countless loads of dirt, gravel, sod, furniture, etc. over the years. Some minor issues with plastic trim deteriorating in and out of vehicle and had the hood and roof repainted due to the hot Florida sun, otherwise no serious mechanical issues. Change the oil twice a year and I just sprayed undercoating to preserve it another twenty plus years and plan on redoing the bedliner (Rhino) with a Raptor product. Overall it's been a reliable hard working truck that I would purchase again.",1
Modern day Cobra with added fiance .  A true sports car.,1

"240,000 miles and going like a champ. 5.9 SLT 4x4 bought it demo from MI dealership in 2000. 18 years of my daily car. He has been an amazing faithful partner, been through and got me out safely of huge snow storms, 2 ft of snow no problem with good tires, ice storms, blazing sun, lived through many years an different states in the South, in the North, driven coast to coast several times. Few issues here and there, transmission broke at 130k, wheel bearings, weak door locks actuators, fuel pump, coil, water pump, power steering pump. ABS, AC down several times and weak in the sun over 100F, But all in all, not bad in 18 years. Take good care of him and he will return the favor.",1
"Great dependable safe ride!
60000 original miles...this car was built solid....every option available that year is on mine.  I will never sell this car!  It will be passed on to 15 year old when he starts driving.  A new SUBARU will be bought at that time.  Love",1
"Best car by far we have ever owned. ""J"" serial Japanese build. It has over 225,000 miles and still runs and drives great. It uses zero oil between changes and shows no signs of rust anywhere including the original exhaust. Even the interior looks new when cleaned. It has survived 2 teenage drivers and daily usage in Ohio's varying weather conditions. Only mechanical repair was a water pump that was functional but leaked a little. 1 set of brakes (front only), tires, and regular maintenance is all it has required in 10 years, incredible. Wish I could buy another new one now.",1
It is one of the most reliable cars ever made. The 3.8l engine is very well made and has a long history. The gas mileage on this car is great. It is so comfortable to drive. If you can find a low mileage one. BUY IT!,1
Very fast shipment and receiving it pretty fast was AWSOME!! Would buy from again A++++++ very good Quality as well!! Thanks,1
Very Good on gas!!!,1
"We bought the new RAV4 Hybrid back in May and now have nearly 8,000 miles on the vehicle accumulated driving between CT and NC, mostly on 81.  That means we pass through CT - where we ALWAYS get stuck in long jams of stop and go traffic, through NYC, around curves and up and down very steep hills.  In TN, they are so steep there are turnouts for runaway trucks.  There is not a traffic condition this vehicle doesn't handle beautifully - and that includes accelerating uphill into bumper to bumper truck traffic on 81. It does all of this while carrying a lot of bulky cargo and getting great gas mileage.  What's not to love?",1
Best truck I have ever owned.,1
Fit perfectly!!!!,1
I find just about everything I need for my truck here on amazon.,1
Great,1
Just like original mirror. Easy to install. Great price.,1
The best!,1
This has been a great little SUV for me.  Going on 10 years and have had no problems from it.  Just routine maintenance.  Has plenty of room for my needs.  Service thru the dealership has been above standard.,1
Best production car ever built,1
I bought this car new in 1999 for my wife's birthday. Other than normal maintenace this vehicle has performed flawlessly. The few item's I have purchased from amazon for it have worked fine.  Dennis,1
"I have the convertible model and I love it, however the floor boards do tend to flood during heavy rains leaving the carpet behind the passenger soaked. Not sure how to fix this maybe there's a clogged drain in the side panels.

Other than that I love my car.
Reliable and fun to drive",1
"It's reasonably reliable, it's very capable, and overall it seems to work well. Parts are cheap, and it's straightforward to repair.",1
"Awesome investment, works great and went together quicker and easier than I was thinking.",1
"Fantastic vehicle.  It's the first one owned that I have I've cared to hang onto for more than a few years.  Spacious, powerful engine, comfortable ride, excellent fuel economy, very reliable.  Not once have I regretted buying this gem.  The repeated high rankings of this model on Consumer Reports is deserved, for sure.",1
Favorite car we have ever had. Love the great features. Drives like a dream.,1
"Working good so far..Bearing is not a hub and bearing assembly. It does have to be pressed onto the hub. You can buy it OEM as a complete hub and bearing assembly for around $235.00 but I couldn't find a aftermarket complete assembly for a 2001 subaru legacy..
I have a press I bought at harbor freight so I was able to press the bearing on to the hub myself but it was extra work to get old bearing off the hub so I could press new bearing onto the existing hub.",1
Lots of space and great for travelling with kids.  Car handles great and has many safety features.  Like it better than the Cadillac SRX that it replaced even though it lacks some of the SRX features such as forward parking assist and keyless start.,1
Great car but a lot of performance mods have been done.,1
Great,1
Amazing car,1
"Excellent product fast delivery
I feel good about it",1
"I've had this truck for 11 years (169,000 miles so far.) I pull a 35' toy hauler with it and have only had minor issues (wheel hub went out)
I love this truck and will keep it until it dies completely, although it doesn't yet show signs of stopping.",1
"Very good truck, plenty of power with the 4.0, very solid with good room with the extended cab. Absolutely no complaints.",1
"I bought my 1999 Tahoe LT second-hand from CarMax in 2006, with some trepidation--Chevys were not, at the time, rated as the most reliable trucks on the road. What a surprising journey it has turned out to be. After 160k miles, I have replaced tires, brakes and batteries, and one fuel pump--that's it. Everything else rock-steady. Oh, the radio knobs broke over time and a few switches stopped working--I will replace them if need be (who really uses the seat-back inflator?). But overall, a delightful, nearly maintenance-free experience.",1

"My family has owned many vehicles in my life and most have died around 200,000 miles. Both of our Jeeps are over 250,000 (mine is nearly 275,000 and my father's is just over 300,000) and are just as reliable, if not more reliable, as my brothers new car. Both of them cost under $1,000, and fixing them is extremely easy and cheap. Also the 4.0 Liter I6 is nearly indestructible. I have run it without oil, or coolant, (not intentionally) and it had no problems. I tried to find one with a blown engine that I could use for extra parts, but it is nearly impossible to find. You will most likely scrap the vehicle after the body rusts away with an engine that is still running strong.",1
Its amazing,1
Best truck I ever owned.,1
"American feeling on every road! Easy handling, no expensive spareparts, powerfull and the perfekt combination of truck and normal car",1
Great vehicle for my college-aged son. Extended can has room for all his school things and his baseball stuff. Runs great. Very dependable. Great on gas.  Sport model is cool looking. Can't go wrong. These trucks are bulletproof!,1

"I love this truck! I have yet to find anything that I do not like. It has a very smooth ride, not rough like others and it gets great gas mileage.",1
Its a great reliable car with good pick up n go. Fairly decent gas mileage especially on highway. Has a lock on inside driver door to both gas cap n trunk for additional protection against theft.you must use your key to unlock it in order to be able to open those features. I love my jetta. I did hv to pay 99 dollars to purchase a spare key because it has a chip in it n had to be programmed in order to start my car.,1

Next project is front end restore.",1
5 stars,1
been excellent truck after owning one year,1
"I have owned many of these 323iC very reliable car, the convertible top sometimes do fail, but the problem is usually minor,  that  may require many hours to trace the fault, parts are not expensive, many complaint against the car engine, is not base on facts, and is also related to mechanics lack of knowledge, or improper repairs by owners themselves, lack of proper maintenance will lead to many problems, not just with this car but with any car, also buying Chinese made or substandard after market parts will often fail, leading many to blame the car as unreliable, I have friends who also have these models with almost three hundred thousand miles on it, I have owned 5 series with over three hundred thousand miles on it, the motor is essentially the same inline six as the 3 series. BMW make great motors silky smoothed and reliable, fun to drive cars.",1
Extremely reliable motor with a 20mpg average fuel efficiency.  The bed of the van is big enough to accommodate a full size bed and kitchen and still leave plenty of room for storage. It is the ultimate vehicle for overland adventures.,1

"I love this truck, I've bought lighting, audio, replacement parts all here on amazon. and I am very pleased with everything I have purchased.",1
"Bought the 2500 Laramie Power Wagon, and love everything about this truck.  Lots of power, lots of room, great ride, and comfortable enough for long drives.  The fit and finish is fantastic, with nicely detailed stitching throughout, and an extremely quiet cabin.  Due to its sheer size, it can be a bit of a pain to park, but that's expected for a large pickup.  You will find yourself hunting for parking spots, because your Ram won't fit in many of them.
The Power Wagon model is extremely capable.  It has 1 ton axles (solid axle front and rear) and both have electric lockers.  It has an electronic front sway bar disconnect (just like the Jeep Rubicon), which helps with articulation over extreme terrain, by keeping the tires on the ground.  The truck comes with a Warn winch nicely tucked in behind the front bumper.
This is the most capable truck sold on the market today, there really are no competitors.  Sure you can buy another brand and spend $7k in aftermarket gear to get it to the same level, or you can buy the Ram and get it all, with full warranty on all of it.
This is the swiss army knife of the truck world.",1

I still have to make several repairs and I'm sure I'll get them,1
"We bought this car new and it has been excellent. Approaching 80K miles and other than some very minor things the car has had zero issues.

I purchased the Tucson Sport version in Black. Its got pick up when you need to get out into traffic or onto the highway. Great Gas mileage. Has an automatic lift gate when hands are full just stand at back gate & it unlocks & lifts open for you. Features for Auto lock doors when you're bye yourself, all doors can remain locked while pumping gas. Not too small or too large of a car. My mother liked mine so much she sold her brand new Chevrolet Camero after 6 months & bought her the same Sport Tucson in Silver.",1
18 years of totally trouble free driving. My C5 looks and drives like new. It is in my opinion one of the best cars GM has ever produced.,1
Awesome,1
"I have owned my car since 2011 and purchased it with just shy of 38,000 miles on it. Overall it is a great car. I did a ton of research before purchasing it and am happy with how it has performed to date. It now has 103,000 miles on it.

There is an issue that owners and potential owners need to be aware of with the steering coupler bushing. Over time the OEM one tends to degrade and eventually needs to be replaced. This is a common issue with various Hyundai models. I had mine replaced about two months ago for $330 by a local mechanic. Almost all of the cost was for labor because replacing this part requires disassembly of the steering column. The part itself can be found on Amazon for less than $10. Mine had degraded to dust; there was only a small o-ring shaped piece left otherwise. The symptoms of this issue is an odd clicking or clunking when turning the steering wheel and it jolting just a bit with the click. It feels like it's getting caught on something then ""clicking"" free. I put off replacing mine initially because I was told it's not a safety concern. By the time I got mine in to be replaced (about 3 or 4 months from initial onset of the clicking) the EPS malfunction light was on steady and occasionally blinking when I first turned the car on. When it was blinking it was clear from how the car handled that the power steering was not functional. Since replacing this part the EPS light has not triggered once and the car handles smoothly again.

I wrote this lengthy post about the steering coupler to aid future searchers with this issue. When I tried to Google it, I found a myriad of answers and none all that recent. When this issue was first cropping up in Hyundais, dealerships were commonly replacing the entire steering column at a cost to owners over a grand for just the part. The issue has been narrowed down to just the steering coupler.

"Great car with a lots of options,  but the handling performance went down by far. Car got a lot heavier and much bigger, than e39 or e60. Only if f10 had the performance of e60, the car would really be an ultimate driving machine. Which I can't  say it about f10 model. Maybe the new G30 is better, I don't know. But if you go for the comfort and a luxury car, with a lot of options,  f10 is the way to go.",1
"Outstanding truck!!! I'm 100% pleased with its design, comfort, fit, finish, and performance. It pulls a 10K trailer with ease. Only item I'm less than thrilled about is the SYNC system. Occasionally it has issues were the phone interface activates without a call or my direction.",1

"A dream car! After 1 year of ownership, I cannot imagine driving anything else anymore, except maybe the newer Tesla P100DL! This is in fact not a car in a traditional sense, it is something new entirely. Try one (or any other Tesla car for that matter) and you will understand what I mean.
If you are used to loud noises, stinky gas and oil smells, and suffocating exhaust fumes, then stay with your fossil fuel car that is based on a century old technology, but you'll miss enjoying the future while it is available for you now! By driving electric, you'll be at least helping to keep our air clean (even if you are a climate change sceptic).
Tesla is the biggest technology disruptor right now, and they are years ahead of the competition, no matter what kind of silly concepts/Tesla killers they might show you, only Tesla is able to sell you such a technological marvel RIGHT NOW!. Although the P85D was replaced by P90DL and P100DL, it is still a beast! With a measured 864 ft-lbs (over 1170 Nm) of instant torque, 0-60 acceleration in 3.1sec. and over 250m/400km of pure electric range supported by Tesla's ever expanding supercharger network, you can't go wrong with this one!",1
"Absolutely love everything about it.  Key features on the iSport are the blind spot monitoring system, rear view camera, bluetooth phone system, hands-free calling and commands.  Very smooth, quiet ride.  Gorgeous sand interior.",1
"As the original owner, I can say with confidence that this has been a great and reliable car since day one. I still have this car and I drive it every day. It still looks great and rides beautifully. On another note, I have always been happy with the service on the vehicle. Although I did not visit the dealer that much, I did take advantage of this with in-warranty repairs. They were all somewhat minor and there were very few, but the dealer went out of their way to make it right. This vehicle continues to exceed my expectations except for one thing. I have the fully loaded touring edition and I am surprised at the low blue book value is today. I've looked at other cars that were $15k less when new, but have a higher resale now. This surprises me and is something I am unable to understand.",1

Dad tearing the front passenger seat with the fishing hook, that broken a/c vent when someone kicked it, that trip to Houston... it never ends. How can you not love a car with so many memories? I dare you. to try. You must get this car.

"I have a CIVIC EXT with CVT and Honda Sensing. I paid for the Honda sensing because I'm 61 years old and I was commuting 150 miles from Indianapolis to Evansville, Indiana once a week and the drive was very boring. My last car was a Buick Verano. I actually retired a few weeks ago so I no longer need to make the trip. But while I did this car was awesome. It was quieter than the Buick. It connected great to my iPhone and I could listen to podcasts to entertain myself on the trips. The car practically drove itself. All I did was set the cruise and go. If I started to drift if bumped back into the lane, it speeded up or slowed down to keep proper distance from other cars. And it looks fantastic. Mine is Blue and I've had many people randomly compliment how nice it looks. When I was young I had my share of muscle cars, Camaro, Corvette, etc. Of course this car is not that fast, but it will get up and go for sure. 2016 was definitely a big improvement in the design of this car.",1
Had this truck about a month and so far we are enjoying it.,1

The Rubicon is an absolute blast to drive and is an incredible performer off-road. I have driven it in Moab in stock configuration, with a 2-inch lift and later with a 3-inch lift and 33 inch tires. The stock 31 inch tires lasted 78K miles before I replaced them.

The Rubicon will handle snow, mud, rocks, cliffs, dirt or highway miles with ease. While surprisingly civilized on the highway, this is still a truck with truck characteristics. Do not expect it to handle like a Mazda 3.

One of the best elements of the Jeep platform is the easily expandable configuration and wide availability of aftermarket parts.

My Jeep has ... a 3"" suspension lift, steel front and rear bumpers, a winch, full skid plates, JKS track bars and steering brace, lights, rear cargo carrier and jerry cans and an on-board air compressor (for tires and air tools.) The electrical system is easily expandable, so accessories that aren't jeep specific are also easy to install (lights, on-board computer, etc.)

All of those upgrades were easy to install -- this Jeep is both a dream to own as well as work on.",1
Great truck!  Comfortable and strong.,1
it's very nice car,1
"Great little car, typical Honda build quality. 178,000 miles and going strong, 23-25 mpg combined city/Highway.",1
Dependable with very little maintenance needed. Probably because it's mostly a Toyota with a few GM parts thrown in.,1
I love my Ravy! It performs well in snow and ice. I feel confident driving it in the mountains. Its super comfortable and roomy! My hybrid is also gas efficient.,1
"This little car is comfortable, handles well on icy and snow packed roads. The dual overhead cam delivers good power for a 6 cylinder. It gets reasonably good fuel mileage. About the only complaint I have is it is little noisy in the cab.",1
Great car. only very minor problems in the 2+ years I have had it.,1
Excellent fit and looks great. Good value for the money.,1
I buy it for a friend he like it. Easy to program no time at all,1
"The accord is a staple of american sedans for popularity and reliability.  This model is no different except for a limited span (06/07) they decided to make this slightly sportier version.  The 244HP V6 coupled to the 6spd manual transmission makes this grocery getter much closer in performance to the Acura CL/TL since they share much of the same drivetrain.

The interior amenities on the EX version are great.  Road noise is a bit higher than on previous accords I've owned but that's mostly due to the 50series tires and stiffer suspension.  Overall the engine is nearly inaudible over the stereo even at moderate volumes which makes shifting sometimes a bit challenging.

Like all Hondas I've owned, everything just works.  This 10yr old car has no creaks, rattles, clunks to speak of.  The interior is almost pristine with the exception of the driver's carpet mat that shows a divot from the right heel.  The leather seats and trim look like new after a bit of scrubbing with some conditioner as well as the steering wheel.

My only gripe is the steering wheel.  I would have much preferred the radio controls be located more at the 7 o'clock location like on my Toyotas rather than at the 9 o'clock as they are now.  I normally hold the wheel at this lower location so I have to shuffle my hands back and forth to change the radio settings.  The cruise control buttons are opposite at the 3 o'clock and it would be nice if they were lower on the wheel too.",1
Eco-Boost is it,1
2 door sport.  I love it.,1
"Missing some of the bells and whistles of other cars or minivans (automatic doors and headlights, for instance), and the middle row bench and rear captain's chair combo can be a bit of a hassle if you have multiple car seats in the middle row and need to access the back, but all of this is mitigated by the stylish design, the narrow exterior (easy to park in narrow spaces), and the smooth ride. It drives like a sedan and the visibility is second to none. Highly recommended for families.",1
"Honda pilot, what can I say, we got the car used but it's been a great car we got with 35,000 mi. Now it has has 160,000, for a 2006, if change the timing belt, oil, tires, this car will last a long time I love it",1
I always enjoy driving this car. I've had mine for 3 1/2 years and have had no major issues.,1
Perfect fit high quality.,1
Perfect performance,1
This Van in my opinion is one of a kind. The Generation 1 of these GM vans were better than Generation 2 or 3. The body never rusts and the 3800 engine gives it nice horse power even for a family van. Only downside is if you live in harsh winter areas it can be rough on the under-body. I got my van from my mother as a graduation gift in 2009 and its still on the road today in-spite of the Michigan harsh winters. 22 years old and still running strong.,1
"Great car, easy to maintain and easy on the gas, now have almost 200000 miles on it still running like a clock",1
Awesome pickup!!,1
"GREAT, dependable car. Low maintenance cost and great mileage",1
Just what I order.,1
This vehicle is my fifth Odyssey. One can put 8 passengers  or a Christmas tree in this vehicle that handles like a small car with a great turning radius.  This model is much better insulated from road noise.  Very fuel efficient for a larger vehicle and accommodates multiple child seats. Will buy another in 4-5 years.,1
"This car has been very reliable, good on gas, and I haven't had any engine problems with it yet.  I bought it at 70k miles and I have 120k now.",1
This awesome product,1
Great parts and great price,1
"Bought this car for my wife recently. It is excellent in ways I never expected. Its spacious in both the front and back. The only only place lacking space is the trunk. I do like the versatility it has by being able to drop the back seats and passenger seat in case we need to take a long object from home depot or some other household item. The radio controls have a nice feel to them and the interior screams quality. The interior reminds me of the Audis I use to drive when I worked in valet.  It is simple, beautiful, and nice to touch. Another outstanding thing about this car is how quiet it is. The road noise is drastically lower than many other cars I've been in. The blind-spot detector and back-up camera are extremely useful features. The car drives with a stiffer suspension that I imagined, which I actually love. It doesn't feel like an SUV that might tip over at any moment, it feels like a car that can hug some corners. I have a really hard time finding anything I don't like about this car. The mileage we have been getting ranges between 28-30 miles per gallon average. That's pretty darn good! I like it so much I am convinced my next car will be a Buick. Acceleration isn't the greatest but its better than my 2004 Honda Civic. If acceleration is a big deal to you, you can get a computer tune through BNR (Bad News Racing) or Trifecta Performance. They offer a tune for about $450 and supposedly it makes a big difference. Since its my wife's car I'll probably leave it alone and just put a simple K&N air intake filter. Overall, I was very impressed with the car, and I never expected to be.",1
I really love my Honda CRV.,1
"Great vehicle. A lot of road noise comes in, but it's a solid dependable vehicle. Gets a good 28 mpg and handles well.",1
Really easy to install,1
Good,1
I love this car mine has  296k still can't hear it running..,1
"Overland model is very nice quality. v8 is awesome for pulling power, and very stable with pontoon/trailer. Highly recommend.",1
Wow. Still amazed.,1
Over 200K and still running great.,1
have 68000 miles and spent very little on repairs. looks like new.,1
Best car purchase I have made.  Simple reliable work truck.  Still have it and drive it daily.,1
"I love my car we are slowly fixing her up, and she runs like a dream, i would not trade her for a brand new car if someone offered it to me free with the switch, it is well worth the investment to get a car just like this you will not be disappointed.",1
What a powerful and gas savior car!!,1
I don't know about other Pontiacs but mine is great. My dad has only had to do a couple of major repairs to it in the last 3 years. The only downside is that the motor for the windows like to go out ever 4 years.,1
"It's the toughest car I ever bought. The things that will break will be around the engine...the engine will never break. So expect heater fan ,radio,etc etc to go bad. That 4.0L beast is unbreakable. ..ask any mechanic.",1
Not fuel efficient but fun is the name of the game. Take the top off and enjoy the ride!,1
Nothing but regular broken parts,1
"2015 S85D. Second hand car for me, I got 7.5 years of warranty as opposed to 4 year CPO along with a 25k price drop.

Let me say a 10 months later that I will never again drive and ICE (gasoline) car unless forced to do so. Everything is instantly quiet, autopilot is great, you feel like you drove 15 minutes after a 3 hours trip. Family of 5, we all all love it. In winter at work I preheat car from office and snow and ice melt off in 5 minutes. With winter tires the AWD is superb.

I love to have broken out of the dealer establishment 1000 past internal combustion service trip vicious cycles, and enjoy a car without having to worry about service, loud noises, and acceleration lag in different weather conditions.

Everything and more that I thought it would be.

And for the range anxiety gang I have great news. Superchargers work very fast, and even stuck in Appalachia will find a PlugShare buddy to accomodate you, just had a total stranger charge overnight at my house a week ago.

Big Oil, your end is near.",1
great truck no problems,1
"Driving over 50 years. Owned GM, Chrysler, Ford and Nissan vehicles.
One of the most reliable, comfortable, fuel efficient and versital cars I've owned. Only one unforeseen repair in 140k miles. Feed it fuel, replace the normal maintenance items and drive.",1
"Very fun, very affordable, as long as you get an S with a 6 speed (do not buy auto unless you want a bad time!). The supercharger whine is great and the car handles the socal mountains with ease. Best bang for the buck on the market, they are so common their value is rock bottom. Lots of bolt on after market parts, even some smog legal stuff. All of it fairly affordable as far as custom parts go.",1
"Best car I have ever owned.  According to Consumer Reports, the Pontiac Vibe is in the top 3 of the most reliable vehicles made in the last decade!  Sporty, good pickup, very comfortable, great sound system, good gas mileage (29 city/36 freeway), extremely reliable, and good driving performance.  Pontiac Vibe was one of the first sport miniSUV's, and to this day is still the best.  Ask any Pontiac Vibe owner.  The reliability of a toyota (the engine is a toyota corolla engine), and Pontiac sporty styling and a great sound system, moonroof, and excellent storage capacity.  The cargo space is awesome (the second row of seats fold flat, with hard plastic cargo floor, with D-ring tie downs, and the front passenger seat folds down so you can carry very long items in the cargo space.  There is also a 110v A/C electric plug in the console, just like the one you have at home in a wall.  Great for charging laptops, cellphones etc!  TOYOTA, GMC....please start remaking the VIBE.  Vibe owners are of all ages and stages.  Ask any one who drives/owns one...we love our Vibes.",1
one of the best little trucks ever made.,1
Since 2001 star buying ford trucks to me is the best purchases i did thank's ford motor company,1
Exactly what we needed.,1
I love my Cadenza.  The car certainly is a head turner.  Mine is Smoky Blue with high polished chrome.  Drives like a dream.  I have owned mine for a year now and I have not had one problem with the car.  I don't see how anyone couldn't love this car.  Gas mileage could be a bit better but this is a large car so what can you expect.  I don't have a single complaint about the car.,1
Magnificent car.  It was love at first sight and still is.  No problems and runs like a scalded dog!,1
Love my Rubicon 2015 jeep. Rides smoothly,1
"The Toyota Tacomas are great small trucks, they get great fuel economy, low maintenance costs, decent ride and able to park about anywhere.",1
Relialable !,1
A solid truck with a good stance. Have owned Ford and Chevy before and the Dodge Ram is by far my favorite of the three.,1
I've owned several V8 Camaro's and although this one has the 6 cylinder it doesn't disappoint.,1
"I really like this vehicle (Cruze Hatchback) and often get compliments on the look and styling. The only issue I had at first, is getting/finding accessories since this body style was just introduce to the market when I purchased it. Now after a year, these accessories are slowly coming to to the market.",1
I like it,1
"One of the best built vehicles I have ever owned.  Currently 18 years old, 70000 miles and no rust, rattles or squeaks.",1
"I have owned this vehicle since I saw it on the trailer when it arrived to the dealership, it was my first new car.  I have had zero issues with it over the last 13 years.  Fuel Pump and new convertible top.  I live in the midwest and it has been stored every winter from October to April thus it's never seen snow.  Other than a little paint fading this vehicle has been amazing and I am looking forward to passing it down to one of my children.",1
Bought it from a little old lady...9000 miles. I'm the second owner. I am approaching the first oil change since I bought it.,1
"I bought it new in 2000 and have driven for over 16 years.  I will replace it when it needs to go to the crusher.  It has been a great truck.  Only problem was frame rusted into in 2015, but Toyota replaced it at no cost to me. I am a skier and hiker, so the TRD off road 4 wheel drive has served me well.",1
"Styling.  Can carry lumber etc..enough power for me. 18 miles per gallon in Dallas traffic. Easiest to put on seat belts. Can easily see out everwhere. Bought new January 2007. best car I have ever owned. I have the limited , so it has lots of extras.repairs in all the years I have  owened it probable $500.",1
Last and Best TJ...!!,1
Excellent.  Best all around utility vehicle I have ever known of.  Sad that they no longer make new ones.,1
"Currently 211,000 miles and just keeps on keepin' on. 3.5 V6 with awesome acceleration and good gas mileage 24 MPG.  I highly recommend Camry and have had four, all V6's. I have rented the four cylinder models and they are great if you value economy over performance. Actually the 4 cylinder is not too shabby on performance either. My first Camry was a 1996 with a 3.0 V6. I sold it with 375,000 miles on it and still running well.  In addition to the 2007, I just bought a 2014 SE and love it.",1
Good running car very reliable,1
"Only had for a few weeks, but so far I love it.",1
Just an awesome truck can't say anything bad about it,1
"I bought my 1997 Lexus LS400 at a Car Auction in 2000. It had 86,000 miles on it. I paid $22,500 plus paid for breaks and tires. I was scared at first, but started using Quaker State synthetic oil (do not use a blend, spend the extra and get ""full synthetic"") and with Lucas Oil Stabilizer at 10,000 mile intervals. It is now 2018 and I have over 350,000 miles on the vehicle. This is the original engine and transmission. It is a fantastic car. It is getting old though, but I really want to break the 500,000 barrier with this original engine just for fun. Do not forget to replace the timing belt/chain every 100,000 miles. This is an interference engine and you do not want it to break or it will cause engine damage. I do not think that I can afford a luxury sedan at this time, but this was a good investment and I am glad that I did.",1
A like this car,1
"I love Toyota, and I absolutely love my car. My previous Toyota, a 2004 Corolla, had over 200k miles on it. I only had to buy a new car because of a horrible accident. I went with a RAV4 because I absolutely feel safe in a Toyota, from experience, and wanted something slightly bigger. My RAV4 is fabulous on gas and is so easy to drive. I love the backup camera (and the big screen), my comfortable cloth seats, and how my back seats recline. I also love how much room I have in the back when I put the seats down! I just wish that its more compatible with my iPhone, like being able to reply to a text, but Im no big deal. Im going to drive this thing until it won't let me anymore! ",1
Great little car,1
Most reliable and capable suv.,1
"Great vehicle, dependable, fast, sure footed and equipped with more niceties than ever needed.",1
Best Car Ever for the Price !!!,1
One of the most fun cars you will ever own!,1
"Great vehicle if you are a Jeep person! My 4dr Wrangler is more spacious then it looks and offers the 4 doors that most families need. Great in snow (it's a Jeep!) and the removable T-Tops offer plenty of sun and wind in the warm weather. If you really want sun and wind remove the entire roof. I have had very little go wrong with it mechanically and other then replacing my tires and brakes (which you would expect after 50,000 miles), It's towing capability is awesome too. Hardly know the utility trailer is there. My wife and I have purchased 11 Jeeps in our lifetime and this you also did not disappoint!",1
This truck is a workhorse! 180000 miles and still going strong! Easy to work on... you just need to take care of basic maintenance and this truck will really pay you back!,1
My 87 dlx has been on its side 2 times and its roof once. Sunk it to the roof for 8 hours and it drove with a hole in the block when a rod snapped. I rebuilt my truck with all 00 Tacoma parts and custom stuff. It impressesme every time I drive it. Toyota reliability is top notch. This truck is not for sale,1
Awesome truck!  This is my 2nd Titan and I love it.  It is built like a tank and drives very smooth.,1
Love the sun shield,1
Exactly what I expectec,1
Havent installed yet. Looks decent quality and right fit for my car. Good price. Delivered on time,1
I love the car the fuel mileage is fantastic,1
"I love my Nissan Titan. I bought it brand new and have had little problems with it. It's a good work truck and has never been babied, but has always performed.",1
"Love it, had a x5 BMW as last car, Hilander drives and handles just as well and is 20k less.",1
Best truck I've ever owned! Alot of power and torque! Will pull anything with no problem!,1
It matched perfectly.  So easy to assemble.  The past part I saved $225.00 that I would have been charged to do the work.  Thank you Amazon.,1
love it!,1
Totally reliable.  Had for 11 years and still going strong.,1
"Very good car,40mpg on the highway on a long trip. Quiet ride. I love it!",1
I've received excellent service from my 2009 Silverado. I had to replace front suspension ball joint etc. about 90K (warranty) miles and a fuel pressure sensor at 104K miles.  I have 112K+ miles on it now.  I have a 9k lb tractor as well as pine logs that I haul frequently on a 21 ft trailer - no transmission troubles at all.  I recently installed a back up camera for convenience.,1
Great car. Have the V8 which sounds so good that I never use the sound system. Excellent trunk space and with the fold down rear seats plenty of room for hauling stuff on your vacation,1
Very pretty car.  And comfortable.,1
S54 M Roadster - most fun you'll have on four wheels for the money. Comparable to Porsche performance for half the money. The car is also relative easy to work on for the DIYers.,1
"I liked especially the great gas mileage and very generous cargo space.  Also, very clever use made of space available (compartments and pockets).",1
Easy to fix. Luv it,1
Great power and wonderful sound. Hard to beat A-body styling,1
Great Car,1
Went in very easily. Looks exactly like it was original equipment.,1
"This van has been incredible. Has gone to Europe and back, and just over 200,000 miles, we have had very little issues! Very Dependable vehicle!",1
"I can't speak on the base model, but the type-s model is a fun car to drive.  The manual close ratio gears, smooth shifts with 200hp in this light, agile car is a great combination.",1
"Great truck, bought it new. 2007 F150 XLT 4x4 Extra Cab 5.4 engine with shift on the flyTow package.  Pulls 7000 lbs ( car carrier with Mustang Cobra or Ford Edge ) Gets 10 to 14 mpg towing, get 16 to 18 mpg empty.  Has 120,000 miles on it and looks and runs like new,",1
"Extremely comfortable and quiet with lots of useful storage space.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  Acceleration and handling are average.  In a nut shell it has the space of an SUV, but drives more like a sedan.",1
Awesome truck. All the three star and lower reviews writers do not want a truck. electric seats? really!? The truck delivers in every way a truck should to the average user and more. Drive feel is very nice and maybe a little under powered as far has racing performance goes. But again it is a TRUCK!!! Miles ahead of the competition!,1
"After 17 years and 175000 miles I have not had anything break that stranded the vehicle.
I did have to repaint it, Duponts crappy paint error!",1
"I have owned 4 cylinder for 15 years, 192,000 miles. My coworker has 6 cyl with over 300,000 miles. For a car made in 99, this is amazing. I just replaced the original exhaust. No rust, but the paint is worn never being garaged. I leased a 2012 Prius; the ride was not any better or quieter. Even though the Prius got 47 mpg and the Camry can get 30 mpg, the time between gas stops is about the same with the Camry's 18 gal gas tank. From Toyota's view  the Camry was a mistake because it was made too well.",1
I love my ride! I work in Silicon Valley. All the hot shots on the parking lot are trying to have a cooler car than the next guy. Spend $100k and you will still only have an average car on the parking lot. I'm the only one on the parking lot with a 30 years old Mercedes in mint condition. Whenever we go out for lunch everybody wants a ride in the pimp Mercedes. I had it for 2 years now and it is bullet prof. Never lets me down and the ride is awesome. In general easy to work on and easy to find maintenance parts. Upgraded with roof rack for two mountain bikes.,1
I thought it was a great truck and the options that you can choose from.,1
one of the best looking muscle cars out there,1
Best vehicle ever.,1
My Camry 6 cylinder is as good a Lexus 350.,1
Best truck I've owned,1
Very nice,1
Great Truck!!,1
"I bought this Avy new back in 2005 after owning a 2003 for 3 years. This was a full change model from the previous year, and a drastic graduation from the 'geezer mobile' impression that Avalon had always had to the styling that is much more acceptable to younger market. My Touring model had some '1st year issues' in quality that I had to have fixed, including rear air spoiler adherence, rattle in the trunk, etc. I also felt that it was less rigidly built than 2003, but this might have been due to the different trim levels (2003=XLE, 2005=Touring=less quiet). I loved some details it had (subtle LED illumination on the dashboard, cupholder cover, console cover, self-leveling HID headlights, etc.). I believe this was the last year Toyota installed a tape player in their vehicles, and I exhausted my ideas how to utilize/repurpose the area of the console during my ownership of this car. Overall, the car held up admirably during its 10-year (130K-mile) life with no significant mechanical, electrical or cosmetic issues at all. It was not able to withstand a 40-mph impact from the rear as the insurance company declared it 'totaled'. The crumple zone in the rear DID work perfectly, however, that the cabin area remained completely in tact while the entire rear section was completely compacted by the impact. I was not hurt in any way at all, either. I am now a owner of 2015 Avalon Hybrid XLE Touring which I also love and hope to own for a long time.",1
"I love this car. Has roomy insides. The rear storage is nice, when the rear seats are folded down you can stack like 6 bodies in the back. The engine runs like a top, however it does lose oil somehow.
The transmission is excellent (made by Mercedes)",1
Best Truck by far!!,1
"I love my car. They drive for ever, enough room to fit my kids in, multiple air bags throughout the car good on gas comforatable..i have the wolfsburg edition and its very fast. Parts are generally easy to find. On a scale of 1-10 i give the car a 7.",1
Best and most reliable vehicle I have ever owned! It's our daily driver and weekend warrior!,1
Everything I purchase for my car made it look great,1
"I purchased this 2011 Sahara Unlimited new from WP Chrysler Jeep back in January 2011.  It has proven to be an excellent all around vehicle.  I got through a few snow storms without any problems.  Off roading is where it really comes into its own.  Over the years I've added a number of improvements like remote start, a Mopar 2"" lift, Goodrich KO2 tires, off road bumpers.  I've not had any problems and only performed normal maintenance at the Dealer (who is excellent with Jeeps). I have the older 3.8l engine that is not as powerful as the newer 3.6l engines, but I am happy with it as it is.  The old 3.8 uses a cast iron block where the new engines use all aluminum engines.  I am thinking the cast iron blocks are stronger and should last longer.  I used to get around 20 mpg on the highway but since I put the new tires on I'm getting around 16.  The trade off is worth it because the traction increase is very noticeable, especially off roading. I don't have lockers and still get through almost anything.  In any event, the beauty of the Wrangler is that you can make it into anything you want and it will perform in almost any environment,",1
One of the best cars for the money. 100% reliable and gets 30 mpg.,1
fit like a charm ....I put it in my self in 10 minutes or less!!,1
"Words can not describe the performance and handling of this car, a must drive for any car lover. Worth every penny!!!!",1
Its a ride,1
"I bought a CR-V touring model last summer and I love it. It has great pick up, smooth feel when driving. Gas mileage is amazing when I set the intuitive cruise control. This one has leather seats and seat warmers. I live in central Arizona so chilled seats would have been a better choice. This vehicle replaced a Kia Sportage. Anything would be better than that.",1
"201,000 miles and still a nice car.",1
I love my 2010 Nissan Titan! Lots of power and a very comfortable interior.,1
"277,500 Miles and still runs great!",1
"The 95 with the 1.8 OBD1 engine and manual transmission, has just enough power to keep this aging car fun to drive.
Parts to customize, tune, or individualize these cars, are plentiful and reasonably priced.
Any of the reasons that I hesitated getting one of these first generation MX-5s, for one reason or another, has been washed away with each time I am able to drive it.
If you're considering one, do your reasearch and buy the nicest example that you can find.",1
"Fun to drive, expensive to repair once out of warranty.  But, I have 220,000 miles and still running strong with very few rattles.  The interior and paint have held up exceedingly well and the car still handles great.  It is nice to have a 12 year old car that is reliable, fun to drive and not remotely making me want to trade it in yet.",1
"Love my car in style and performance, just needs to be restored that is all and it is currently on being worked on.",1
this car is the best low on milage an I have 222567 miles on it but its a noice little reliable car brought it for my daughter .1998,1

"What a great vehicle to own and drive. It handles exceptionally well and easy to operate. The interior is very comfortable and all the touch controls are either on or close to the steering wheel. It looks like a Million Bucks on the road or in the garage. The Red Rock color is an eye catcher and the trim, wheels, rims, are spectacular. We love it.",1
"Love the stance of the long bed.  the downward body line that is right below the top of the rail.  The slant goes from about 2 inches to four. my before and after, or after and before.",1
My truck has given me good service for the past 18 years. I have a 21 footer boat and with hes motor 6 cylinders and 4.0 liter has does a great service towing it. Have change the normal wear parts and still going strong. Long live the Ford Ranger XLT 1999.,1

"I use my Wangler for everything. It is great in the Snow, it is great in the beach, it is also great for picking up building supplies. The Wrangler is very fun to drive. I push my Wrangler to the limit and it always handles it with ease. The company I work for is open 24 hours 365 days a year (Phone service provider) ans we are located in Massachusetts Due to 911 Emergancies it does not matter what the weather outside is we have to go in. The Wrangler got me through the 2 foot of snow we got every week last winter with no issues. Plus in the summer I take the doors and roof off and enjoy the breeze. There is nothing better than taking the winter out for a picnic in the middle of the woods knowing we are the only ones around because other vehicles can't get to where we are .",1
Everything about this truck is expensive...you get what you pay for.,1
"I love this truck.  It has plenty of power and just keeps running.  My truck has 230,000 miles and runs strong.  It pulls well, and gets average fuel economy of about 15mpg, regardless what i am doing with it. I am glad i have this truck and wouldn't trade it for anything.",1
"2016 2.5 Outback Limited with the Eyesight system, the interior, and the tech package, this by far the most advance vehicle I have ever owned, still learning much about the vehicle.  True pleasure to drive, loads of space, passengers love the leg room.  Audio system is top notch

The EyeSight option package adds a power moon roof, navigation with voice control, a three-year subscription to SiriusXM Traffic and TravelLink, and the EyeSight driver assist system with adaptive cruise control, pre-collision warning and braking, lane departure warning and assist, adaptive fog lights, sway warning functions, and more.

The StarLink 7-inch Multimedia Navigation system offers some of the most comprehensive connectivity we've seen, most of it via a connected smartphone. The required gateway app provides news, weather, and a music player function, as well as apps for iHeartRadio and Stitcher. The Aha Radio app adds streaming music, news, and podcasts, as well as local search capability to find food, fuel, and other services in an area. There's a separate app for Pandora Internet Radio, and the system has individual apps for weather, fuel, sports, and stock info via Sirius TravelLink.

The 7-inch touch screen and its large iconsalong with six capactive touch buttons around the screenmake the interface easy to use. In addition, several screens let you rearrange icons according to your preference. There are some issues, like the lack of an Audio Source button on the home screen, and that the capacitive buttons can be difficult to manipulate at a glance, but these are easy to get used to. A bigger issue is that we couldn't get the connected appsStarlink, Aha, and Pandorato work at all.

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.",1
"Bought the limited edition green flash spring edition, I absolutely love it!! I enjoy driving her and on occasion burning the tires :)
Come winter time I am going to go into withdrawals from not driving her during the winter months.",1
great,1
I absolutely love my Honda Element. The VTech engine is the best engine Ive ever had the pleasure of working on. It has 205k on it and only had to do minor things so far. Just done a full maintenance on it and can't believe how good a shape it's still in. The only advice I can give anyone who owns these vehicles is to use Honda oils only in this motor. They are made specifically for these engines. Other oils are to heavy and gunk up the sensors. I wish they hadn't stop producing them.,1
"I have had this truck for 6 years and have out 74,000 miles on it without a single major issue.  Oil changes and tires is about all you need to do to it and down the road we go.",1
"First off i would like to say that this is by far the most reliable car i have ever owned... I have used and abused it for years and at one point when i had very little knowledge on car maintenance i drove my volvo for a month without any engine oil and still did not fail me never ever left me stranded this car is strong, reliable, and extremely safe i would most definitely buy another volvo in the future. Thank you guys for making amazing vehicles i could rant and rave about this car for hours, really love my volvo",1
Best small SUV ever made period!,1
Love my Durango and the 5.7 ltr Hemi,1
"Large roomy and comfortable. The Roadmaster rides like its on air. Very reliable and easy to maintain vehicle. This is from when GM still new how to make cars. It was a mistake to discontinue the B/D Body cars, all of which featured the legendary bulletproof 350 LT1 V8 the most solid engine to ever roll off GMS assembly line. Problem areas are very few. One is the windows will sometimes fall of there tracks and occasionally the distributors fail. Mine is in gorgeous medium garnet red metallic.",1
Love my TDI JETTA 190000 mile and going stong,1
"Exceptional toy, especially during winter using 4-wheel drive",1
Great vehicle that has stood the test of time.,1

Very simple design, quiet and fuel efficient.",1

"The E38 7 series Is one of the best vehicles Bmw has ever made they are truly very stylish but still has a classic look to it people say that this is one of the time was designed BMWs and it truly is. No matter how old it is, if you take care of it it will last you forever. You cannot cheap out on the maintenance of these vehicles because it will leave you walking if you don't take care of it",1
"Dependable, economical , transportation.  A good roomy car that's quite and rides nice.  Very happy with my Ford Taurus",1
Very very reliable durable trustworthy its a great fourwheel drive vehicle. I like the bench seat,1
"Pride of the fleet. Awesome power from a high pressure turbocharger. Will outrun almost anything on the road, Runs on Z rated tires. Good mileage on the highway. Magnificent Dolby Surround stereo. Great brakes. Huge carrying capacity. More stable at speed than my BMW. A true Swedish Race Car. The engine was blueprinted in the UK. The car was assembled in Belgium. Part of a special Rally car series.",1
Love it!,1
Awesome Truck!,1
Has turned out to be the funnest rig we have ever owned. It can take us anywhere on road or off road and we still have plenty of room for our two year old and dogs!,1
It's a Great little car. It's a turbo and It will get You a ticket for speeding if Your NOT careful... Gas mileage is Awesome. The only thing I don't like about it is the metal is so thin. Parked under a oak tree and When the acorns fell off it dented the car. It looks like it was in a Hail storm. That's the only bad thing I can think of.,1
GMC Duramax LMM.  Works like a champ.,1
I and my Wife love this car and will not be giving it up anytime soon.,1
"Excellent all around vehicle, good value, dependable, holds it value.",1
"Most likely the best vehicle I've ever owned. I know these models and most Chevrolet trucks have issues with rust in the wheel wells, but the older models are great when it comes to reliability and the motors put in them. I much prefer the 5.3 liter version of the Vortec they used to put in these. They're also really great when it comes to hauling, as that's what their transmission is geared to do. If shopping for one though, try to get yourself the Z-71 off-road edition, just for reliability sake. The four wheel drive function is a bit tedious to service, but very worth it.",1
210k still going string....low cost to maintain.  rebuilt transmission at 88k,1
"Drop down a gear and foot to the floor. You'll get rid of tailgaters, Prius owners, and environmentalists. Better mileage than Prius. Better looking too. This car is perfect in every way, unlike the Prius, which is trash.",1
"Best truck I've ever owned.. Only thing I've had to replace on it is a water pump at 188,000 miles.. That's why I'm spending $4,000.00 to restore it.",1
Thanks,1
Mega cab great room to spare,1
A great car. I've had it for 12 years now. I've only had to change the battery once and replace a couple parts here and there. The new subaru forester is very high tech and too large for me. It is the best car that I have owned.,1
"My GMC Sierra is a SLE Crew Cab and when I first looked at it I couldn't believe how roomy the cabin was. Also rides smoothly and is very quiet. Good power with excellent fuel economy and after 85,000 miles no mechanical problems.",1
Very good item it works,1
Yes,1
"The safest, most functional sedan on the road.",1
Great car all round. Easy to get in and out with a comfortable ride and ample room inside. Very dependable and great gas milage. 103 thousand miles.,1

I love this van.,1
"Best car I have ever driven and owned. From its curves and simple lines to its acceleration, light weight, and handling in the curves....unbelievable.",1
Great truck. Comfortable in town and a beast off-road. Be ready for its size.,1
"My wife bought this top of the line Camry Hybrid in 2008 as her daily driver.  It now has more than 154,000 miles on it.

In that time it has not needed any warranty repairs, or any other repairs - it's had no mechanical or electrical problems whatsoever in 8 years and 155,000 miles.  That's got to be some kind of record.

And these weren't a bunch of highway miles - although it has made a few road trips, it has been driven from the suburbs into the city and home every day.

The car is still comfortable to drive and gets about 35 mpg.  Every switch, button, feature works the same as it was when new.  The leather seats are perfect. It even retains some of the new car smell to it.  With a good cleaning and fixing some door dings you could put it back in the showroom.

The hybrid system and battery still work fine.  I estimate we've saved about $5,000 - 7,000 in gas money over those 150K miles over a standard 4 cylinder Camry -  The Hybrid model cost about $3 -4 thousand more than the standard car, so that was probably a good deal, although not as good of a deal with gas at $2 vs when it was around $4.

The real value of these cars are saving money on repairs and not having to replace it with a more reliable car after 100k miles  Most other cars I owned (prior to buying Toyotas) cost $2000-3,000 per year in repairs after the warranty period.  This car has cost nothing - that's another $10,000-15,000 in savings.  Oil changes, tires and gas are all this car has had.  I don't know how Toyota can build cars this good.

So this car has saved  at least $15,000-22,000 in gas and repairs over it's life.  It's not the most stylish or luxurious car out there (Lexus ES is the luxury version of the Camry), but it does get you and your family where you want to go about as economically as you can.

I highly recommend these cars.",1
Reliability like no other plus great fuel economy.,1
"Just bought the red TOURING yesterday and I love it!  I owned a 2003 Civic EX for 10 years and it was the best car I owned.  I ended up buying a VW CC and what a lemon, so I went back to what I know except THIS Civic is like a luxury car.  The features are amazing and I look forward to many years with it.  Definitely get the touring.  Worth every penny.",1
"If my Santa Fe ever dies, I will buy another one just like it.  I just love everything about it.",1
"Performance and handling, room and comfort",1
Great product for the price.,1
"Bought with 23 miles in 93 , Calypso Green XLT . Its now got 362000 on it . 3 trannys couple alts pretty much welded every part back to the frame and changed springs towers gas tank brackets ect ect . All due to Salt on roads in Illinois winters . Love the truck ! Its been hit several times and totaled out by insurance  company but still drive it every day and looks good lol .  Got some 15 inch rims off a Cherokee and General Grabber at2s . Couldn't ask for a more dependable ride the last 25 years .",1
"I have had my car since 2002, and I really have enjoyed the performance that it has given me.",1
I love this truck. Hasn't let me down yet and it's fun to drive.,1
Great vehicle that I still love to drive.  Mine is just about to go over 100K and it has performed great.  I do all the regular maintenance when Ford says and everything has worked well.  Couldn't be happier and I plan on keeping the car a few more years.  I did put a Kenwood SAT/GPS/Blue tooth radio in it a few years back to I'd have all the convenience of the new cars without having to spend $60K on a new one.,1
"I absolutely love my Z3, taking good care of it, the value is there.",1
It is good,1
"Where to even begin? I'm blown away.

PROS:
This redesign is breathtaking. Previously, I had owned a 2007 Mustang, which I certainly loved but, like with most other loved ones in your life, there are probably a few things they need work on. I'm proud to say that the S550 has not only fixed those faults, but has moved above and beyond.

The first and most obvious change is the quality of the build. It's apparent on the outside, but to really understand, take a look at the interior. No more hard plastic, no more cheap knocking sounds, no more squeaks or exposed metal. 95% of the interior is either leather, metal, or soft-touch plastic. It's just a thing of beauty, and feels like a car two classes above.

The styling is something to behold. That being said, you MUST see this car in person before you decide to look at other makes and models. Pictures don't do this car justice, and I'm not just saying that casually. In person, this is a different car. It's some kind of voodoo. The car is 3 inches wider than the previous year, it has those aggressive supercar haunches, appears longer, and these lines are just beautiful, from any angle. Functional hood vents, the fast back, that great grille setup, just awe-inspiring. This is a poster car.

The tech is really well developed, and you have ALL the amenities of a car that's double the cost. The SYNC 3 system is awesome and intuitive. The key fob doesn't even need to leave your pocket to unlock the car, start the car, pop the trunk, or lock the car back up. Awesome! The push-button start feels special every time you use it. Even in the little things, it's overflowing with innovation--garage door opener integrated into the visor, sensors in the door handles, customizable accent lighting all over the place, backup cam with trajectory marks standard, lamps on the bottom of the door mirrors that project a pony emblem onto the ground--so many wonderful tech items that I can't even begin to list them. READ THE MANUAL or you'll never know!

The ride and handling, just wow--mine has the 5.0L Coyote with the 6-speed manual--what a total beast. Selectable driving modes, selectable steering feel. FINALLY has an independent rear suspension that makes this thing ride like an absolute DREAM compared to the old one. with 0-60 times running in the mid 4s, you're keeping up with BMWs and Mercs that are going for more than double the price for the same performance. All of this for 15 city, 25 highway--which is great, considering you have a 435 HP monster V-8 under the hood. Throw a cold-air intake and a tune on there and you'll be doing high 20's for mpg on roadtrips, no problem. You make no concessions!

CONS:
Too quiet for a 5.0L Mustang--I want to hear that Coyote howl! Will be investing a couple hundred in a new catback or axleback exhaust system. That being said, the car is extremely well sound-deadened--the cabin is very, very quiet.

No hydraulic hood struts--it's 2016, this is a $40,000 car, and you're still making us use a hood prop rod? Come on, Ford! Can be fixed for under $100 in the aftermarket, though!

Can't say enough that's wonderful about this vehicle. I have the extended warranty, because I know she's going to be with me for a while. Do it, you know you want to.",1
Mirror works great,1
"I love this car more and more every day. It's been reliable so far, but I've been on top of the maintenance since I got it. Take good care of it and you'll have a good time",1
Great truck easy to maintain,1
Love my LTZ!,1
Great comfortable car for road trips or trips around town. Avg 20mpg. Has options that cars from other companies didn't have for almost 10 years after this one and they still work great. I have put over 100k on it since I bought it used and it is still going strong. Great car for our growing family.,1
"A pleasure to drive, and I can fit a set of tires, jack, tool box in the car. This is my fifth BMW. I had a E46 330Cic, E36 M3, E39 M Sport,and have a M Roadster. All manuals. Had a half dozen Porsches too.

What do I know? Im just a fool with a butt dyno. Dont take my word, read the reviews the professional journalists wrote. They hit it on the head.

BMW did not give me the car. I was not paid to write this review. While some people take part in programs where they get free stuff to evaluate, I am not one of the chosen people. My opinion that my opinion is worthless is based on my subjective opinion. Before spending thousands of dollars on an old car, read the reviews written by people that compare hundreds of cars a year, not some fool like me who bought the car because his money was burning a hole in his pocket.",1
"2008 F150 ""XLT"" trim, 2WD. Good power for only 4.6 liters, VERY spacious & comfortable interior (I'm 6'3"" & 240). Being only a ""supercab"" & NOT a ""supercrew"", it actually has enough rear seat legroom for young teenagers. Pulling a loaded trailer the engine struggles, so get the 5.4 if you tow a LOT.  Since I only pull a loaded (16' flatbed) trailer maybe once a month, I'll live with it just fine. The ride & handling are excellent as well. The truck is comfortable for our young family of five, & we may consider moving up to a supercrew later on as kids get older.",1
"For what they are designed to do, they do very well. Great off road or in the snow. Fairly easy to work on - very reliable. I get 25 MPG no matter how it's driven - 65 mph on the highway, in town driving, or 2nd gear on bad roads.  Only negative is the small gas tank. There are some known issues with the EGR system, but, even at 100k miles, mine doesn't have the issue.  I added a modest (2"") suspension lift and Old Man Emu shocks/struts - made a world of difference on washboard roads. I replaced the alternator and oil pressure sending unit @97k. Other than routine maintenance, (oil changes, tune ups and timing belt/water pump), I haven't had to repair anything.  Interior holds up well. Exterior - - clear coat is slowing peeling away (common for cars this age) - gives it the camo look.  Overall, a very simple, reliable car - great off road, good value.",1
"It's an excellent car, very fuel economic and resistent.",1
"Great truck, I love that they offered a convertible model in early 2000.",1
Its a classic,1
"200,000+ miles and still going.  Original motor, transmission, front axle, and transfer case.  Unbelievable!  Body is in perfect condition.
Only issues have been the fuel pump and rear axle- both replaced well after 100,000 miles.  Leather has worn out on from sliding off drivers seat.
I'm thinking about rebuilding the drive-train instead of buying a new one!",1
"I loved this van. It has a smooth ride. I liked it so much I would have bought another when I gave it to my daughter-in-law in 2012, but they don't make them anymore. She still drives it with my 3 grandchildren. It has 120,000 thousand miles. Unfortunately, the seats are extremely heavy and hard to remove and store. My next car is a 2012 Town and Country with stow and go seats. Almost as nice.",1
LED conversion kit was perfect..driving a nite now is like having night vision...great,1
"2008 Tacoma Access Cab is used for camping, kayaking, and mountain biking.  The TRD Sport hauls rocks & mulch to save it's big brother Tundra's bed lining for toys.  Tires, Oil, Filter, Fan Module, Water pump (72K) are only issues in over 100k and 8 yrs of daily duty.  I camped out it for 3 weeks in western NC mountains.  It holds gear for 2, toys for 2, tows well and has 6sp manual.  My only improvement would be better noise isolation in the cabin.  V6 is powerful and fun on forest roads.  4x4 works great in upd tow 2ft of snow.  Towed a Highlander out on Christmas Eve from remote area.  Size makes it easy to park at airports, road side pull offs, crowded river launch areas.",1
"At 140000 miles, my 1992 TYPHOON is still fun to drive. Daily transportation for me, Love it........",1
This has been the best all around car I have ever owned. It gets great HW MPG (29) all in complete comfort. I have over 200k miles on her and still love it. I would buy this car again in a second.,1
I've had this car for a long time because it's very fun to drive but also I do my very best when it comes to maintaining I.,1
The best truck I ever had!,1
Best SUV I have ever owned! Love it!!,1

The Kiva by but was the best thing ever $19 worked perfectly I don't know why I waited so long to get one I didn't know Amazon had it Best Buy ever,1
After several Ram 1500's I decided to purchase a 2500 Cummins Diesel truck. Couldnt be happier and love the truck. Great engine and easy maintenance. Will keep this truck for many years!,1

"This is my third Jeep.  The first two where Grand Cherokees, 279K, 239K for mileage.  My liberty has 223K and running strong.  I have reservations about the ""new"" V6 but it ahs been awesome.  Basic repairs have kept this one going.  I do my own work BTW.  I'd recommend any Jeep and I'm looking forward to my next.  Gas mileage isn't good in any of them, at least the true four wheel drive models, but I can go anywhere and do.  Love Jeeps.",1
"Great mid size truck, easy to park , plenty of room inside,crazy fuel mileage.( Diesel engine). It's a gazelle on the hills,dam thing will tow 7000 lbs. ride is nice,not a z71 suspension. Big back up camera screen, awesome stereo. Heated seats,leather interior. So far I love it.
What I wish it had. CD player, sun/ moon roof.",1
"This is the Best vehicle I have ever owned. I purchased it in 2005 with just under 50,000 on it. It now has over 240,000 miles on it. The only issues I have had with were minor and expected, Alternator replaced a couple of times, AC Compressor replaced once, Thermostat housing replaced a few times.

Considering how long and hard I have driven this truck it has held up well. I believe this truck would still be in production if not for the EPA.",1
The products I purchased for my car have been great! Right size and always works,1
The best car you will ever own,1
"I have a 2010 f250 6.4. I use it as a farm truck. I have the dpf, and egr delete, and i love the truck. I have 100,000 mile onit and never had a single problem with it.",1
"Great vehicle I have 190,000 mi and still runs and looks good",1
Awesome truck with the duramax engine,1
"I bought my Winter green, five speed stick Honda CRV 1998 with 70,000 miles on it. I paid less than 6,000. for it at the time. It was 7 years old and only needed new tires, wheels alignment and a tune-up. I've had it for over 9 years and have had very few problems with it except due to age and use. With regular oil changes and upkeep, this garage kept light truck has been reliable in all weather situations. A Standard shift is the only way to go with this make and model. It is excellent on gas and mileage and on the highway it has quick response and truly flies. I have dusted Porches, Camaros, Chargers and many other newer, faster vehicles and while it doesn't look the role it handles well and is safe and well made. In short, I love this vehicle.",1
"Bought my Frontier, in July,  after finally finding the right one for the right price. It is a 2013 S with automatic. It had 19,800 miles on it, and I love it. I average 22 MPG with the 4 cylinder. A/C works well. So far there have been no problems. I had a 1990  that had a ton of miles with very few problems, so wanted the 4 cylinder. Meets every need that I have, as I do not tow. It rides great, and I enjoy it.",1
I love my Chevy Impala SS!!,1
"Great truck,great torque and power.it has 37x12.5r 20in tires with upgrades on motor",1
"I've had my Jeep Patriot since June 2010 and its run like a champ ever since.  Yea, its slow off the mark, but it has never broken down on me and has kept my family & I safe and able to get around.  Maintenance-wise, I've kept up on oil changes & just changed the spark plugs at 100,000 miles.  I've changed the tires twice since I've gotten it, but that's it.",1
What's the difference really between a 2012 and the new 2016?  Just a few subjective changes here and there.  Buy used and save tons.,1
Duramax with the Allison is hard to beat. I have owned them all and I feel the Chevy 2500hd is the complete package when it comes to turbo diesel 4x4 trucks. My truck has a 6 inch lift with 35s and I consistently get 13/18 mpg and it will drag anything behind it with plenty of power to spare. Don't forget the lbz turbo mouthpiece which will fix the overheating problem and turbo back the exhaust to make egts insignificant.,1
"This car may only have 98 horsepower, but it's pretty fast. Perfect for an everyday driver. It has apple car play and android auto which is heaven in this car.",1
"I bought this truck off of my grandfather about 4 months ago with 325,000 plus miles on the motor and transmission. The truck is a bone stock 1998 ford F-150 with all numbers matching parts. It's been a very well maintained truck for it has been used in a factory since it was produced. I have driven the truck since 2007, and little blue still runs like a dream!

On a side note, I plan on turning it into a rubber burning machine (with a rebuild of course) and was wondering if anybody could help me out on recommending parts? Thanks a lot!",1
Love the amazon Garage feature.  it works great,1
"I have owned several of this body style and they are hands down one of my favorite cars on the road. Easy to work on, parts are cheap and respond well to aftermarket modifications. Currently have a 93 hatchback with 225k on the odometer and has required little maintenance. Honda really built these cars well and I plan on driving mine until i can't anymore.",1
"A wonderful car. Excellent power and appointments. My nephew has a Lexus with the same chassis and engine, and I don't feel there  is much difference except for a few options that I don't need. It really is an excellent automobile.",1
"Cost effective to maintain. Fuel economy excellent. Just enough room to haul major appliances and furniture in bed of truck. Can pull up to 2,000 lbs in small trailer.
Great visability through all windows. The straight 4 cylinder has enough horse power.",1
"I was in the car business for 10 years and this is one of the best driving vehicles I've ever driven. It has given me very little issues. Basically only maintenance needed. I love having a third row seat in a pinch. It would be nice to have more cargo room
With the 3rd row but You would need to sacrifice leg room somewhere else and I don't use it that often so I'm fine with that. I bought this Sport Model used with 30k on it and now have over 100k. Drives like the day I bought it. Highly recommend.",1
Old chevys never die .,1
"We bought this 2013 Toyota Highlander as a certified pre-owned vehicle from Premiere Toyota, in Amherst, Ohio. Just over 29K,with a clean car-fax, locally owned. Very well equipped and everything works well. Very comfortable and easy to drive. Engine is a V-6 and had plenty of effortless power, up and down WV hills. MPG  was approximately 24. The dealer replaced the tires and brakes, all new, quality parts. We received very good certified warranties with very good follow up service from the dealer. Amazon has a long list of parts for this model, OEM Toyota and after market. I intend to shop Amazon for any accessories, if needed.",1
Very good truck,1
"Stylish, comfortable and fun to drive.",1
Great car 40000 miles no problems at all,1
I love my car,1
"Awesome vehicle with lots of room, smooth ride and handling with lots of technology built in.",1
Im a life long bowtie fan. I love my silverado. Its by far the best vehicle ive ever owned. Over 140k miles and not one problem.,1
"This was the first Subaru I owned, but it made me fall in love with Subaru. The dependability, quality, and utility of this vehicle was unmatched, and that boxy design is, in my view, timeless. I'm on my third Subaru now, but I will always have fond memories of this Forester. Subaru for life!",1
Awesome truck. Tough as nails and won't let you down.,1
"I bought mine as a demo, and all I've had to do is normal maintenance.  It's 2017, and I'm still driving it.  But I'm an outdoors guy, and I do bicycle to the grocery store, etc.  Had it during military service, lived in three states.  Buy a foreign product?  Sorry, REAL Americans don't do that snowflake!!",1
Just made sure all parts #s were correct other than that very quick dependant,1
My husband loves this truck.,1
Awesome product with price tag just right... worth every penny ,1
"They look good, haven't put them on yet so don't have much to say",1
This truck is bullet proof,1
Hyundai got it right with this hybrid. It provides excellent mpg and performs like a luxury straight gas model. It's loaded with features and it has needed only 2 tsbs in 9 months and 11000 miles of wonderful service. I love the comfort of the best warranty in the business even if it's not needed.,1
"Best car I have ever owned, and i have owned a few.  Bought new in 04, it now has 267,000 miles on it and still going strong.  Regular maintenance, timing belt every 100k, new head gaskets and clutch at 200k and thats it!",1
most badash sumbitch on the road!!,1
Great car!! As long as it is well maintained the Prelude is a fun dynamic car that gives lots of bang for your buck,1
"If you want one of the greatest full size diesel pickups of all time, this is it. Equipped with the legendary 5.9l Cummins diesel, one needs not worry about towing. This motor, stock, produces 325bhp and about 600lbs of torque while attaining about 20 mpg on the highway. With a few modifications these numbers easily increase. If you're on the road a lot with a heavy payload or trailer of any size, this is the truck for you. Don't bother with the Hemi version (weak sauce!) and beware of the automatic transmission as this tends to be the week point of the model (too much power for a stock auto tranny!) What you are really purchasing here is the fantastic Cummins motor.",1
I love it,1
"It has performed wonderfully.  I have no complaints.  Although I replaced it two years ago, I gave it to my sister who drives it without problems.",1
Great truck,1
"great truck, very dependable.",1
"got the LTZ model, this is so safe and comfortable. We love it.
Lane departure warnings, auto cruise control distance control, goes into the 4cylinder mode when not calling for a lot of power.

Can get 4 sets golf clubs and 2 suit cases in the back when 4 of us go golfing.

LUXERY at its best.",1
Best car I ever have,1
Everything was great worked as stated,1
Pretty neat old car you don't see this one at every cat show original 350 rocket still going strong.,1
"Truck is very spacious inside & out.  Had to get the 5.5 foot bed, cause the 6.5 wouldn't fit inside our garage.  I'm retired so don't do much hauling anyway, but do miss the extra length when hauling fence post.  Truck has the oversized (Ford thinks so anyway) wheels, so the ride is really good, especially for a truck, engine has more than enough power to push this big heavy truck into traffic without straining, the real gas mileage about what I  expected.  I've changes all the light bulbs with LEDs, also added a hard shell bed cover, running boards, rain guards, & with all that came on it, I have it pretty much like I want it.",1
Love my car! Zx2 sport,1
"I love this truck. This is my daily driver. We go camping in this and I love off-roading in it. Not fuel efficient but what else do you expect from a monster 5.7L engine. I find it more comfortable than my Mercedes C300. It doesn't turn, brake, or accelerate like a car and that is the only drawback. This is going to be my ride for many years to come.",1
"Had 7+ years of ownership, none major problems what so ever only Starter/Spark plugs/Belt/Transmission fluid change once, mostly oil changes and once in few years brake pads change, 3.5 engine runs very good so as good transmission.",1
Its fun to drive and is not overly  complicated to work on,1
Exactly what I needed. It shipped fast and was a perfect fit.,1
"Awesome luxury car, still better than 80% of new cars on the road today. Made when Lexus/Toyota was trying to build a brand for itself so it was a no holds barred exercise. Very affordable on the used car market for a RWD, 4.0L V8 sedan. Recommended!",1
"Very happy with this vehicle. Well made, it gets great gas mileage, low maintenance, rides wonderfully.",1
LOVE MY USED CAR,1
plugs & wires  best deal,1
This is my third Wrangler it is the best vehicle I have ever owned whether rain sleet or snow my Jeep gets me there.,1
Very reliable. Low maintenance. Can't beat it.,1
"I am not a car guy.  At all.  Well, unless it has a big V8 and goes really fast.  Normally, I like to drive pickups.

Having said that, my commute is just too long to drive a thirsty truck.  So, I started researching the Chevy Cruze.  But I was only interested in the turbo diesel model.

The TD was only made in 2014 and 2015 so they can be tough to find.  But I was able to locate one within 200 miles that was in near-new condition even though the odometer showed 30000 miles.  Great shape, still under warranty and the dealer delivered it to me.  All at just over half the cost of what it was new.

The TD models are near the top-end of trim levels.  Mine has a sunroof, heated leather seats, navigation, backup camera, etc.  Very well equipped.  I like the interior...it's comfortable and functional.  I'd like a little more front-to-back tilt adjustment in the power seat but that's about my only complaint.  It's pretty much a typical Chevy economy car interior but with upgrades.

Visibility is great.  I have no problem seeing around the car with the mirrors and when looking behind during lane changes and maneuvering.  Fit and finish is very good.  Lots of room in the trunk and the rear seats fold down so you have room for longer items.  You could probably sleep there in a pinch.

The diesel models don't come with a spare tire.  They come with a ""fix-a-flat"" kit...a can of stuff to inject into the deflated tire and a mini compressor.  The spare tire space contains the DEF (diesel exhaust fluid) tank.

Where this car really shines is in the engine.  The 2.0L turbo diesel not only has plenty of power, it gets incredible fuel mileage as well.  Mine averages a little over 44 MPG back and forth to work.  Coincidentally, it's 44 miles round trip...so I use about 1 gallon of fuel per day for my commute.  It's not loud but you can hear the traditional diesel clatter a bit at idle.  On the road you can't tell...until you put your foot down.  The torquey diesel responds quickly.  It accelerates much quicker than the comparable gas model.  Chevy puts the same motor in close to half a million cars each year in Europe.  It also has the balance of the 100,000 mile powertrain warranty so big dollar maintenance issues shouldn't be a problem.

The 2017 Cruze should have the new 1.6L diesel in it by summer.  I've heard mileage will be even better and the price will be around $25000...a little more for the 9-speed auto, a little less for the manual.  If it's anything like the 1st Gen models it'll be a fantastic car.

Highly recommended...if you can find a nice used one, BUY IT!",1
was amazing match.dealer wanted 2x as much.customer loved it.direct no hassle fit!!,1
Excelente,1
Awesome car.  Owned since 1965.,1
"Never been in love with a vehicle the way I am with my ""Ginger"". So easy to modify, my children love it, don't have to sacrifice any cool points as a mom either, can go anywhere in it. Best vehicle I've ever had. Aloha from Oahu",1
Love the new Tahoe. Handles great and a very smooth ride especially for a 4WD.  Love the my link system for Apple play or Sirius/XM. The only issue if the DVD screen is down hard to see out the back window.,1
Best car ever made.  No other car interests me since I started driving a Tesla..,1
This pic looks exactly like mine. I bought it new in 97 and still have it. The engine was replaced with a used one at 275K miles. Overall it's been great. The 5.4 engines make it difficult to replace the COPs (coil over plugs) but overall it's been easy to maintain.,1
Bought new in 2004 480k on it. Doesn't burn any oil between 15k oil changes. Belts hoses timing belts and water pumps is all the fixes. Would definitely buy again.,1
"It's been a family vehicle, a mudtruck, school transport and a burnout machine lol and at 250,000 ol Thunder nuts is still roaring like the day it was made. Can't kill the dang thing....",1
Love this car. Almost 300000 miles on the clock. Parts are cheap and mileage is great even with some mods.,1
VERY SIMPLE TO INSTALL,1
"225,000 miles and still going strong and I use the hell out of it",1
175k miles and never a single problem,1
With just 2000 miles so far we are very pleased with the Tahoe. Surprisingly it is getting very good gas mileage for a large vehicle.  The ride is smooth and comfortable and seems to have more than enough power to tow just about anything. If it lasts as long as our 2004 Tahoe which we still have and driving we will be very happy.,1
Great way to get around plus carries just about anything..,1
"Amazing car when taken properly cared of. So much car for the money, although I would recommend getting a 2008 and up as they have better build quality",1
One of the best cars owned. Fun to drive. Holds up to rough usage.,1
"Great car... 120,000 miles and going great... 38mph HWY... handles great in rain and snow... this is my 2nd Ford Focus... had 2001 Focus prior... put 350,000 mi on it before I sold it (still running great) and bought the current one... best car Ford ever made IMO.",1
Good Vehecle.,1
"This is our 5th Subaru (2003 Forester & Baja - kept for 9 years, 2013 Imp Spt Prem, and 2015 Imp 5 door) and as expected, I'm quite pleased with this 2016 Impreza Sport Premium. I replaced the 2013 Imp with this 2016 to get a sunroof and the better audio sys. I thought about giving it 4 vs. 5 stars because there is a distinct difference between the 2013 and the 2016 that is disappointing. Subaru softened the suspension a bit and where the 2013 could handle 70 mph curvy roads and maintain a perfectly flat stance, the rear suspension on the 2016 allows some tilt and is too soft going over bumps - but it's still a lot of fun to drive. BUT the 2016 is also a lot more quiet, the CVT logic is re-tuned and the shifting is much more satisfying, the audio system is one of the most intuitive setups I've seen for screen based controls and integrating with cell phones, the sunroof is a plus, and for driver visibility in this model is a stand out - so the 2016 gets a 5. I'm in the northeast and often get to the Adirondacks in northern NY in various seasons - and like all Subarus, the drive train, stance, and road feel is remarkably reassuring. We got our son a used 2015 Imp Spt for all of the same reasons - plus the rock solid construction and safety systems.",1
"Excellent vehicle. Comfortable, great mileage, excellent workmanship and almost maintance free.",1
Great vehicle and a classic.  It uses some of the same parts as my 70 Mustang.  Ford finds something that works and (sometimes) sticks with it.,1
Awesome truck.,1
I have the srt8 model and it's fast!!!!,1
"If you get a Camaro, do yourself a favor, get the V8. You will be disappointed if you get the base model.",1
"this was a rock solid vehicle. bought new, it carried me and the family through nearly 10 years of road trips, normal day to day, 150k-ish miles, and kept on humming.  It is still in the family, and I expect it to be good for about 40-50k miles.",1
"Really a great car.  It was our first SUV, and we were very pleased with it.  Really good gas mileage (averaged about 21 MPG).  Plenty of room for the grandkids.  Only complaint was the active headrests - part of the SRS.  I couldn't replace them with DVD headrests, as removing them compromises the whole restraint system.  Not really bad, as it was a very safe car.  We liked it so much, we bought a newer one when we traded this one in.  Overall, a great vehicle.",1
Amazing vehicle. Everything that a Sports Car should be.,1
"I agree with the previous reviewer. I bought my black Cobra svt in June 2016, and can/t give enough stars for it. The paint looked fine in the rain but the next day I examined it in the sunlight and noticed that the body had  polish swirls. But can't complain. I only paid 11,5K for it The seller was doing a favor for a the rightful owner who was disabled. The odo read 55xx miles, so the owner and the guy who brought it to me  did not shop around, and had they done that, they would have asked for a higher price. The codition & assessment and inspection revealed it has a stage 2 intake system and  wonderful sound coming from the pipes. The guy told me that the aftermarket replacement parts improved the hp and overall
performance and I agree. SHE screams for more power which she now has. So, I realized that it is not the mpg I was looking for, but she more than makes up for it  with t",1
This truck is amazing. Will pull almost anything,1
I thought the product was easy to use and install works great,1
Great Products,1
Best truck ever.,1
Love it,1
One of the Best Cars I have ever owned and I have own a lot of cars through the years.,1
I own a 2011 vw jetta tdi and I love it!! Has more than enough power  plus I have the luxury of bein able to put it in sports mode or just regular Drive mode. Luxury with out compromising power,1
"I love this beautiful box on wheels! It's true when you buy a Jeep you're not buying a car, truck or SUV...  you're buying a lifestyle! I can't wait for summer though I need to customize the top from my YJ...",1
Been a great Truck,1
"I've had it since new, love it.",1
"I have a 2.3 DOHC, the thing gets rediculous gas mileage
Runes smooth, good in town and on the highway.

But the engine is a pain to work on because of small engine bay",1
It's a great car.,1
"With one computer and parts readily available, this model can easily be a one million mile vehicle. When Ford and Volvo got in bed with each other to ""make changes"", that was the beginning of the end for a company that quickly learned the meaning of ""programmed obsolesce"". Sadly other manufacturers followed suit and it is consumer beware at an all time high starting in 1994.
There are many Volvo car clubs and support groups world wide, all willing to help with even the most complex parts instillation, that being, believe it or not, the blower fan motor located in the dash. That too, can be handled thanks in part to UTUBE and the chance meeting other owners in salvage yards, seeking out those parts that are over priced and sometimes hard to find.
My advice is, find a 240 and make it last. Oh, and if you are a customizer at heart, a ford 5.0 fits nicely with a few modifications. Enjoy!",1
Great truck,1
"I bought a 2003 Infiniti used in 2005 with about 30,000 miles on it; its now 2017, and I have over 240,000 miles on the car & its still running well.  I haven't had any major issues - Ive had to do the basics in terms of repairs and replacing battery filters etc but thats it.  I am forever going to be an Infiniti fan now- Ive had a Ford, a BMW, a Mercedes- and hands down this has been the best car overall.  I will buy a new car soon because I drive long distances and want a hybrid but I've been putting off a purchase because my car just keeps going and going..",1
"This is a wonderful vehicle.  We purchased the four door Wrangler. I love driving it.  It is has manual transmission and the towing package.  Everything we wanted in a Jeep.  We even bought a camper in green that matches our Gecko green Jeep.  Even our dogs love it.  We just have to say ""Get in the Jeep"" and they are ready to ride.  We have the four door Sport.",1
"I wish I had purchased my Jeep earlier in my life.  They're that much fun.  Plus, they are very handy around town with a great turning radius and room for the family.",1
"I've put 500 miles of mixed city and highway miles on mine.  I am a larger guy and find this both comfortable and a pleasure to drive.  Mileage is big truck V8, ride is almost sedan.  I've gotten lots of great compliments.",1
Love jeep I have two rubicons a fourdoor and a two door. They are our DD/ rock crawlers with 4 inches of lift and 37 inch tires. We can do anywhere any time no matter what.,1
"The car is amazing. We own two of them (2013 P85+ and 2014 P85).
I would probably love to update for a newer Model X and Model S, but I realize that our ""old"" cars are still better for family for these two reasons:

1. Can install cargo box on the roof. (It is impossible to do that on Model X).
2. The ""frunk"" is much larger than in today's Model S versions and can fit large stroller (the frunk is much smaller these days due to dual-motor standardization).
3. Can fit 5+2 passengers with the rear-facing seats in the trunk. Of course, only kids can sit at the rear-facing seats, but what a fun it is for them! And if you really have to sit 7 passengers in a car, most likely at least two of them will be kids. So it can fit same amount of passengers and MORE cargo than Model X (roof top box + larger ""frunk"")",1
Expensive parts.  Great car!,1
Awesome!,1
Excellent suv.,1
I Love it!,1
"Great roomy vehicle very comfortable for long rides, great gas mileage. Overall very satisfied after 1 year of ownership",1
7.3 diesel beat motor and truck ever built,1
Great product,1
"2014 F150 Supercrew with 3.5 Ecoboost and max tow package. 65,000 miles on it, 12,000 of those pulling our 9,000 lb 5th wheel around the mountainous eastern half of the USA. Only problem was front end out of alignment from factory and 2 failed Motorcraft batteries. Replaced the second Motorcraft battery with a $97.00 Walmart battery, no more problems so it was the batteries, not the truck. I do advise getting the intake cleaning when recommended by Ford service. Did it at 60,000 miles and mileage improved enough to eventually pay for the cleaning. You may want to get it done at about 40,000. As for towing, this truck has ample pulling power and brakes to handle our camper like it isn't even back there.",1
I LOVE MY CAR,1
Love the car. Will keep it forever.,1
"We're a Jeep family, the 2015 wrangler is my third Jeep and my family's fourth. That being said, I am incredibly biased. The customization options of Wranglers and aftermarket parts make the Jeep community widespread and strong. I traded in my 2002 wrangler for the 2015 and the difference is incredible. The two door version is much smoother on the road and the soft top is even quieter than my old one. Thus far we have put 10k miles on this model and have had no issues mechanically. Keep in mind though, not everyone appreciates having top down and doors off. You'll start getting fidgety at work if the weather is beautiful and even if it rains because that means mud is coming. This vehicle is empowering and will change your life for the better.",1
Love it.  If you want a real truck.  Drives and rides great.,1
"This is my third Pathfinder. The '96 I still have and runs like a clock. The '03 I bought after Katrina and had some problems with it as not Carfax to check when I bought. Still a good vehicle. This '12 is great except that it had no cross racks on the top which I didn't notice until after I had the car. Assumed they would be there as they had on others.
Always by 'program cars"" so had these with varying miles when purchased. Great tide on the '12 once I got Michelin tires on it.",1
Excellent fit. Excellent price. The car is NOT Japanese made. Still it fits.,1
"Had it Bullet Proofed at 100,000 miles. Going on 180000 now with no problems. Service is key....Change oil every 5000 miles Rotella T 15-40...change fuel filters every 15,000 miles. Use only Motorcraft  or Raycor filters...Don't use cheap after market filters....BTW Raycor makes Motorcraft's fuel filters. Truck runs great and doesn't leak or burn a drop of oil. Keep up with the service and it will run forever",1
"Nearly 75k and still on the original clutch, brakes and spark plugs. Oil and air filter changes on schedule. Second set of replacement tires about half worn. Average around 22 MPG, 24 @ 75 on interstates. A/C still on original charge. New battery and terminals about 15k ago. After nearly ten years, still a comfortable and reliable vehicle.",1
"Amazing what Tesla has achieved in such a short time.  Fun to drive.  Snap your ""head to the headrest"" quick on acceleration, tons of torque and power.  Cavernous trunk and very useful ""frunk"" (front trunk).  Solid build.  Head turner and conversation piece.  2015 Model S needs some practical tweaks in cabin ergonomics and design, and needs QC issues to be practically flawless for the price of the vehicles.  But it appears that subsequent year models have improved, which should be expected.  I will probably never go back to a gas engine automobile after this one.",1
Best car in the world,1
A perfect small car built like a tank,1
"my first volvo. very comfortable, simple display everything very laid out well.  this little car is quick and handles well. i get a lot of compliments about this car has many option packages. Im glad volvo only made a few makes me feel special.",1
"I love this truck.  My husband offered to buy me a 2017 Ridgeline and I wouldn't do it.  It is easy to drive, park and load.  Rides better than my previous luxury car.  Always take it on long trips because of ease of getting in and out.",1
I love it,1
best suv ever had!,1
"Much off-road fun, broke many things. Would buy again anyway!",1
"I am on my 6th Mazda made vehicle and have truly fell in love with the drive and room capacity. I am a short woman who is power chair bound. My chair fits in the back end of the van with the second and third row seats removed. I have slept in the van with no problems too. The MPV is lower to the ground than any other competing van, making it easier to get in and out with ease. Mechanically, it's been a trooper and nothing major with it. although all of my Mazda's have an oil problem. I keep records up to date for continued success.",1
love my nissan frontier,1
Love it! Very dependable.,1
"This has been an excellent car for me for the past 4 years. With age comes some suspension and steering work, but the engine has been bulletproof. It's fun to drive, fast and reliable.",1
Bought it when it was 12 years old with 87000 miles.  It had been taken care of and garaged.  Now has 130000 miles with only 2 repaires: cruise control switch and ac hose.  350 engine has tons of torque to pull my 24 foot camper.  Only down side is 14 mpg.  Have started looking for about 6 year newer one just to update but I figure this one would go another 100000 miles.  The problem in older trucks is finding one that has been taken care of because after all they are trucks.,1
Excellent cruising and family car! Comfortable and beautiful!,1
"My family has owned this car all 20 years, and it has been one of the best cars we have ever owned, I have known many people go through multiple cars while this one keeps on going. They engine bay has a lot of space in it making it very easy to work on and a good one to learn how to work on cars with. I love this little car and would recommend one to anyone as long as they can find it in decent condition.",1
"This is the ""Just Right"" Car. Highly reliable and capable. Very comfortable and roomy. Not too big, yet not too small. Not too high, yet higher than a regular car with enough clearance underneath that I can do an oil change without jacking up the car! Comfortable for total of 4 people on long road trips. Around town, 5 is still comfortable. Plenty of leg room in the rear seats. Car is stylish enough to go to nice places and rugged enough to take to the mountains. All wheel drive is handy when it snows. Even better ride with the 3.6R engine (which still has the traditional non-CVT transmission for this 2012 model)",1
"looks great fast delivery , great price",1
I love this cars I have one and it still runs smoothhh,1
"The beast is bulletproof: 270,000+ miles and finally needing some mechanical work. Incredibly reliable and versatile, drives great. The only design flaw is the undersized brakes. Rotors have to be replaced frequently due to warpage. Obviously old technology and it won't win any mileage awards, but definitely got my money's worth.",1
I love this car.  I have had it for 7 years and it has been everything but a 4 wheel drive.  But has held up like one. And the gas mileage is excellent.,1
